I'm an engineer and Dad and tinkerer. I'm on break from many years of
software engineering management &mdash; not retired, just on sabbatical.

For many years, off and on, I've written an old-style [blog](posts).
Most of the posts are about [technology](categories/technology),
[management](categories/management), or [life in general](categories/life).

Much of my life has been working for tech companies like Google, VMware, and
Akamai.  My [resume][] has the whole story.  The best gig was building a site
for online education for Stanford during the MOOC boom of 2012.

These days I'm spending more time playing board games and learning bridge. But I
always come back to tech. I've been doing computer stuff since getting an Apple
//e when I was twelve years old. I spent that whole summer writing a [robots
game][] in 6502 assembly.
