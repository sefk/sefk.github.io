Hi. I'm an engineer and Dad and tinkerer on break from many years of managing software development.

For many years, off and on, I've been writing here on an old-style [blog](posts).
Most of the posts here are about [technology](categories/technology), [management](categories/management), or 
[life in general](categories/life).

Much of my life has been working for tech companies like Google, VMware, and Akamai.
My [resume][] has the whole story.
The best gig was building a site for online Education for Stanford during the MOOC boom of 2012.

I wrote my first computer program when I was twelve years old on
an Apple //e. It was a simple [robots game][] handwritten in 6502
assembly. It took all summer to write.
