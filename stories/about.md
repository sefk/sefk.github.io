I wrote my first computer program when I was twelve years old on
an Apple //e. It was a simple [robots game][] handwritten 6502
assembly. It took all summer to write. That's when I caught the
programming bug and I've still got it. Still it's a good day when
I get to write some code.

At some point I wanted to have an impact beyond just my own two
hands so I became an engineering manager. I went from line managing
engineers (fun) to managing managers (harder) to being VP Engineering
and/or Operations (less fun). While I can do the bigger job, I've
been tending to do more hands-on work lately.

I used to be purely a backend guy -- distributed systems, scalability,
operations. As I've gotten further along I've moved further and
further up the stack and lately have been spending more time with
client frameworks and mobile. Those spaces are technically interesting
now and you can have a big impact you can *see*. And there is so
much [great][s3] [backend][sqs] [stuff][heroku] that you can just
*buy* now! But that doesn't mean that I don't like getting my hands
into ops. In particular I've spent a fair bit of time in the Amazon
Web Services stack and know my way around there pretty well.

In addition I'm a father of two great girls and enjoy card and board games.
I'm on the Board of Directors at [Peninsula School][].

I've done some stuff on [GitHub][] but haven't been very active
there lately.

I maintained [my resume][cv] as hard-coded simple HTML. It's formatted
the way you would format something back in 1998: just barely css,
tables with colspans / divs only for formatting, etc. I use [make][]
to generate a [PDF][] version. Yes, I know, kind of clunky.

Check out the [Tools][] page to see how this site is built and my
day-to-day toolchain.

This site is generated using [Nikola][]. I recommend it. The folks who build and
maintain Nikola produce good software and are responsive. I like that it's in
Python. I wish it had more themes.
