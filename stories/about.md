I'm an engineer and Dad and tinkerer. I'm on break from many years of
software engineering management &mdash; not retired, just on sabbatical.

For many years, off and on, I've written an old-style [blog](posts). Most of the
posts are about [management](categories/management),
[technology](categories/technology), or [life in general](categories/life). I
hope you check it out.

My career has been working for tech companies like Google, VMware, and Akamai,
as well as some startups. My [resume][] has the whole story. The most fun was
building a site for online education for Stanford during the MOOC boom of 2012.

Lately I've become concerned by America's movement toward authoritarianism. I
support the work being done by [my local Indivisible chapter][imp] and the
national [No Kings][] movement and aim to do more.

I'm also playing board games, video games, and learning bridge. But I keep
coming back to tech projects. I got my first computer, an Apple //e, and spent a
whole summer hand-coding a [robots game][] in 6502 assembly. I've always found
that stuff *fun*.
