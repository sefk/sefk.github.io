I'm an engineer and Dad and tinkerer. I'm on break from many years of
software engineering management &mdash; not retired, just on sabbatical.

For many years, off and on, I've written an old-style [blog](posts). Most of the
posts are about [management](categories/management),
[technology](categories/technology), or [life in general](categories/life). I
hope you check it out.

My career has been working for tech companies like Google, VMware, and
Akamai, as well as some startups. My [resume][] has the whole story. The best gig was building a site
for online education for Stanford during the MOOC boom of 2012.

These days I'm spending more time playing board games and learning bridge. But I
always come back to tech. I've been doing computer stuff since getting an Apple
//e when I was twelve years old. I spent that summer writing a [robots game][]
in 6502 assembly.
