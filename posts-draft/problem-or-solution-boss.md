Some bosses want you to bring them problems, so you can unscramble
the Rubik's cube together. Sure it's great to have figured out some
of the problem first, but be prepared to show your homework.

Other bosses want you to bring them solutions or proposals. If you
bring them a problem, you'll get annoyance and "what do you want
me to do about it?"

Most bosses have exceptions by domain. A common patter there is the
techie bring-me-problems boss who'll want to dig in on capacity
planning, say, but hope you can solve messy people conflicts yourself.

I've worked with both and each has their virtues. When you have a new
boss, figure out what type they are and adjust.
