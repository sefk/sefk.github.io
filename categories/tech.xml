&lt;p&gt;Governments should produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"&gt;public goods&lt;/a&gt;, like navigation aids, roads, and
water treatment infrastructure. That seems like a reasonable thing to expect of
a functioning government, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to &lt;strong&gt;remove data&lt;/strong&gt;. All through 2025, websites
were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; tells
catalogs what's been happening; this report by the &lt;a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century"&gt;American Statistical
Association&lt;/a&gt; tells the whole story and implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response the &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/"&gt;Data Rescue Project&lt;/a&gt; sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/"&gt;project's press page&lt;/a&gt; has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers. I was
eager to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on,
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIFLD is a collection of maps. Basic stuff: roads, levees, river depth charts,
locations of military bases. Beyond just being good, generally accessible maps,
a big part of its value is when everyone uses &lt;em&gt;the same maps&lt;/em&gt;. HIFLD is mostly
curating data. Most of the data comes from other (USGS, Army Corps of Engineers,
Census Bureau) that HIFLD brings together and provides it in a trustworthy,
central place. Well, I should say "provided" because in September the
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/"&gt;government stopped providing it&lt;/a&gt;. The story is well told in this &lt;a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.
It's a good read so I don't have to report it all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers scooped up the
data into temporary storage and organized a bucket brigade of volunteers to put
&lt;a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open"&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt; into long-term storage. Importantly, this was coupled with metadata
to ensure they're findable later. That's the part I worked on, uploading and
entering metadata. &lt;a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524"&gt;Frank Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;, the project manager, wrote up a nice
&lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of what we did. I used a nice Selenium driver, written by another
volunteer, to create over a hundred projects (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs"&gt;screen recording&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt; to see
the breadth of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm proud of the work, and very supportive, I keep in mind that this i
still playing defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having
the government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding the
government does better! Assert your rights and &lt;a href="https://www.nokings.org/"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; ❌ 👑.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Civics</category><category>Life</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/data-preservation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
