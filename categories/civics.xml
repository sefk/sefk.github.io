&lt;p&gt;Governments should produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"&gt;public goods&lt;/a&gt;, like navigation aids and roads. That
seems like a reasonable thing to expect of a functioning government, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
thorough measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to &lt;strong&gt;actually remove data&lt;/strong&gt;. All through 2025,
websites were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;
catalogs what's been happening, and this report by the &lt;a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century"&gt;American Statistical
Association&lt;/a&gt; goes into more depth about what's been happening and its
implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response the &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/"&gt;Data Rescue Project&lt;/a&gt; sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/"&gt;project's press page&lt;/a&gt; has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact. Last
November I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers
and was eager to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on:
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIFLD is a collection of maps. Maps of basic stuff, like roads, levees, river
depth charts, locations of military bases. Beyond just being good maps, a big
part of HIFLD's value is helping to make sure everyone uses &lt;em&gt;the same maps&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So HIFLD is mostly curating data. Most of the data comes from other agencies
(USGS, Army Corps of Engineers, Census Bureau) and HIFLD brings it together and
provides it in a trustworthy, central place. Well, I should say "provided"
because in September the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/"&gt;government stopped providing it&lt;/a&gt;. The story is well
told in this good &lt;a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data"&gt;article on Project Geospatial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers immediately
scooped up the data and kept in temporary storage. Then they organized a bucket
brigade of volunteers to categorize and put &lt;a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open"&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt; into long-term storage.
Importantly, this was coupled with metadata to ensure they're findable later.
That's the part I worked on, uploading and entering metadata. We met our goal of
getting all of HIFLD "rescued" by year's end. &lt;a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524"&gt;Frank Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;, the project
manager, wrote up a nice &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of what we did and how. For my piece I relied
on a nice Selenium driver, written by another volunteer, to create over a
hundred projects (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs"&gt;screen recording&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt; to see the
breadth of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm proud of this project, I keep reminding myself that we're playing
defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having the
government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding better
leadership and a return to effective government. Assert your rights and
&lt;a href="https://www.nokings.org/"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt;!   ❌ 👑.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Civics</category><category>Life</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/data-preservation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Dig</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/big-dig/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/bigdig.png" alt="Big Dig podcast title art (WGBH)" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished the &lt;a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"&gt;Big Dig podcast&lt;/a&gt; and it's worth
a listen. It's about Boston's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig"&gt;Central Artery/Tunnel Project&lt;/a&gt;,
the most expensive highway project in US history. They cover the
whole story, from conception, to getting it approved, to years of
execution, and then the fallout from cost overruns and mismanagement.
The podcast is well produced and has a lot of primary-source
interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a little bit of a personal connection, since I lived in
Boston during the project's later years when it was on the news &lt;em&gt;all the
time&lt;/em&gt;. I even toured &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_P._Zakim_Bunker_Hill_Memorial_Bridge"&gt;a part&lt;/a&gt; under construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I find most compelling is trying to connect to the question,
can America build big infrastructure anymore? It's something I think
lot about. We benefit from by the giant projects from the past
(dams, bridges, interstates) but can't maintain them properly; we
struggle to take on new things like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail"&gt;high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They place most of the blame on headwinds that didn't exist in the
public-works heyday of the twentieth century. Leaders are under
more scrutiny; projects fall under a bunch of regulations intended
to protect the environment and workers. Public commentary slows
things down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, while the old way was easier, it also caused a lot
of harm. I learned the story of the Cambridge and East Boston
families that stopped interstate projects that would have leveled
their homes and neighborhoods. I know those places well. I used to
own a home right where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_695_(Massachusetts)"&gt;one of those roads was supposed to have
been&lt;/a&gt;. I sure am grateful to those protesters who won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ends on a hopeful note. Not that it's easy, nor are we necessarily
that much better managing big projects now. But there are success
stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part I especially liked was &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+BDdBHAXcVU/20:47"&gt;20 minutes into the final episode&lt;/a&gt;,
in the final interview with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_P._Salvucci"&gt;Fred Salvucci&lt;/a&gt;, where he told the
story Saint Francis. God tells Francis to build a cathedral, but
then tears it down. Francis builds another, God destroys it again.
Why, Francis asks. Because it's not enough to build a physical
cathedral, but you also have to build the support for it in the
hearts and minds of the people. Maybe that's the part we're not
doing well enough now.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Appreciation</category><category>Civics</category><category>Media</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/big-dig/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
