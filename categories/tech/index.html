<p>When I was fourteen years old, I spent the summer hand-coding a video game. I'd
gone to a family gathering and my older cousin Erik brought his Mac from
college. I loved it, of course. I thought the <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/3913-daleks">Daleks</a> game he had running on it
was so cool. The screenshot on the right is from that Classic Mac website and is
exactly how I remember it looking back then.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized. I'd played video games on my computer, like Hard Hat Mack
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zanShXo4btw">gameplay video</a>), that were state of the art back then. But those were
coded by someone else. This seemed like something I could do.</p>
<p>Once I got back home to Fresno I got to work. I spent most of the rest of that
summer writing a clone of that game on my Apple //e. It was all done in
hand-coded 6502 assembly, I didn't even have an assembler back then, so I had to
do all the opcodes by hand. I had to learn twos complement math to do all the
branch offsets, in pencil on graph paper. The hardest part was getting smooth
animation working, since the Apple //e graphics system was super quirky,
especially the non-linear frame buffer. The high-res graphics section of this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics">wikipedia page</a> describes it well enough.</p>
<p>I remember it took about two months to get it working. It's the first time I can
remember being in a flow state. It began my lifelong love of computers.</p>
<p><img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="../../f/daleks-2026.png" alt="Screenshot of my recent Daleks game" width="50%"></p>
<p>Now, forty years later I'm <a href="../../posts/leaving-google/">on a break</a> and taking a <a href="https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/detail/20252_TECH-42">Vibe Coding class</a>. Our
week one assignment is to code up a game. Out of nostalgia, I chose my old
friend, Daleks. <strong>In about two hours, and spending about $10, I had a working
prototype.</strong> I spent another couple of hours cleaning things up and getting into
version control. You can <a href="../../daleks">play it here</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first experience with Replit. Super impressive. This was also what
the rest of the students in the class used, and most of what they came up with
were much fancier than what I did, with 3d graphics and more interactive game
play. Although I also heard from some students that they ended up spending much
more to get their game stood up.</p>
<p>What was also impressive about this first experience with Vibe Coding was
dealing with backend and integration issues. To get their code deployed onto
this site required wiring up a GitHub workflow. Replit handled that just fine
too, although it took a couple of round trips.</p>
<p>Earlier today I asked Gemini to get local hosting running. There were some
permissions and crashing issues, and I had to resist the urge to run from the
command line myself and start Googling error messages like I normally do.
Instead I had Gemini debug and fix its own errors, which it did quickly.</p>
<p>If you'd like to check out the code or see some construction notes, they can all
be found in <a href="https://github.com/sefk/daleks">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Recently I've been beguiled by my local disk being almost full. This is on my
everyday M3 MacBook Air running the latest Tahoe 26.2.</p>
<p>For years I've used <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/">Daisy Disk</a> to debug space issues like this, it's great.
In this case it showed the problem, but wasn't able to narrow down what the
problem was nor remove it.</p>
<p>Not have any success through the normal means ("Googling around"), I wrote the
developer of Daisy Disk, <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/about/">Oleg</a>. They explained the problem and suggested a
workaround. It worked like a champ! I included the explanation below and
screenshots showing before and after.</p>
<p>I want to say thanks to Oleg for their help. And this is a nice opportunity to
say thank you to indie developers in general who are often so helpful sharing
their expertise. What a wonderful and important part of our community.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oleg's explanation:</p>
<ul>
<p>
This error has recently been reported by a few other users as well, and our
investigation shows that it's caused by a new bug in macOS, introduced in one
of its recent updates. (It didn't happen before). The symptom is exactly like
in your case - a Time Machine snapshot becomes damaged for unknown reason, and
it cannot be deleted in the normal way - not only in DaisyDisk, but also not
in Terminal, using the tmutil command-line tool. Moreover, the tmutil tool
doesn't even list the damaged snapshot. It becomes almost entirely lost, while
it still consumes disk space.
</p>

<p>
We have found the following workaround solution. Please launch the system's Disk
Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and in the left sidebar,
select your data volume, likely called "Macintosh HD - Data". Note that there
will also be another volume called "Macintosh HD" (without "Data"), but you
should select specifically "Macintosh HD - Data". Then select the View \&gt; Show
APFS Snapshots menu command. In the lower part of the window, you will see the
damaged Time Machine snapshot in the list. Please select it and then click the
"-" (minus) button at the bottom to delete it.
</p>
</ul>
<p>And screenshots showing the before and after. Note the two broken snapshots in
the list below.</p>

<p>Governments should produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good">public goods</a>, like navigation aids and roads. That
seems like a reasonable thing to expect of a functioning government, right?</p>
<p>I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
thorough measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.</p>
<p>Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to <strong>actually remove data</strong>. All through 2025,
websites were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals">Wikipedia page</a>
catalogs what's been happening, and this report by the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century">American Statistical
Association</a> goes into more depth about what's been happening and its
implications.</p>
<p>In response the <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/">Data Rescue Project</a> sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/">project's press page</a> has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact. Last
November I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers
and was eager to help.</p>
<h4>Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)</h4>
<p>It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on:
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.</p>
<p>HIFLD is a collection of maps. Maps of basic stuff, like roads, levees, river
depth charts, locations of military bases. Beyond just being good maps, a big
part of HIFLD's value is helping to make sure everyone uses <em>the same maps</em>.</p>
<p>So HIFLD is mostly curating data. Most of the data comes from other agencies
(USGS, Army Corps of Engineers, Census Bureau) and HIFLD brings it together and
provides it in a trustworthy, central place. Well, I should say "provided"
because in September the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/">government stopped providing it</a>. The story is well
told in this good <a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data">article on Project Geospatial</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers immediately
scooped up the data and kept in temporary storage. Then they organized a bucket
brigade of volunteers to categorize and put <a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open">snapshots</a> into long-term storage.
Importantly, this was coupled with metadata to ensure they're findable later.
That's the part I worked on, uploading and entering metadata. We met our goal of
getting all of HIFLD "rescued" by year's end. <a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524">Frank Donnelly</a>, the project
manager, wrote up a nice <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/">summary</a> of what we did and how. For my piece I relied
on a nice Selenium driver, written by another volunteer, to create over a
hundred projects (<a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs">screen recording</a>).</p>
<p>This is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/">tracker</a> to see the
breadth of work.</p>
<p>While I'm proud of this project, I keep reminding myself that we're playing
defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having the
government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding better
leadership and a return to effective government. Assert your rights and
<a href="https://www.nokings.org/">protest</a>!   ❌ 👑.</p>
