<p>Recently I've been beguiled by my local disk being almost full. This is on my
everyday M3 MacBook Air running the latest Tahoe 26.2.</p>
<p>For years I've used <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/">Daisy Disk</a> to debug space issues like this, it's great.
In this case it showed the problem, but wasn't able to narrow down what the
problem was nor remove it.</p>
<p>Not have any success through the normal means ("Googling around"), I wrote the
developer of Daisy Disk, <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/about/">Oleg</a>. They explained the problem and suggested a
workaround. It worked like a champ! I included the explanation below and
screenshots showing before and after.</p>
<p>I want to say thanks to Oleg for their help. And this is a nice opportunity to
say thank you to indie developers in general who are often so helpful sharing
their expertise. What a wonderful and important part of our community.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oleg's explanation:</p>
<ul>
<p>
This error has recently been reported by a few other users as well, and our
investigation shows that it's caused by a new bug in macOS, introduced in one
of its recent updates. (It didn't happen before). The symptom is exactly like
in your case - a Time Machine snapshot becomes damaged for unknown reason, and
it cannot be deleted in the normal way - not only in DaisyDisk, but also not
in Terminal, using the tmutil command-line tool. Moreover, the tmutil tool
doesn't even list the damaged snapshot. It becomes almost entirely lost, while
it still consumes disk space.
</p>

<p>
We have found the following workaround solution. Please launch the system's Disk
Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and in the left sidebar,
select your data volume, likely called "Macintosh HD - Data". Note that there
will also be another volume called "Macintosh HD" (without "Data"), but you
should select specifically "Macintosh HD - Data". Then select the View \&gt; Show
APFS Snapshots menu command. In the lower part of the window, you will see the
damaged Time Machine snapshot in the list. Please select it and then click the
"-" (minus) button at the bottom to delete it.
</p>
</ul>
<p>And screenshots showing the before and after. Note the two broken snapshots in
the list below.</p>

<p>Governments should produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good">public goods</a>, like navigation aids and roads. That
seems like a reasonable thing to expect of a functioning government, right?</p>
<p>I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
thorough measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.</p>
<p>Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to <strong>actually remove data</strong>. All through 2025,
websites were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals">Wikipedia page</a>
catalogs what's been happening, and this report by the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century">American Statistical
Association</a> goes into more depth about what's been happening and its
implications.</p>
<p>In response the <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/">Data Rescue Project</a> sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/">project's press page</a> has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact. Last
November I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers
and was eager to help.</p>
<h4>Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)</h4>
<p>It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on:
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.</p>
<p>HIFLD is a collection of maps. Maps of basic stuff, like roads, levees, river
depth charts, locations of military bases. Beyond just being good maps, a big
part of HIFLD's value is helping to make sure everyone uses <em>the same maps</em>.</p>
<p>So HIFLD is mostly curating data. Most of the data comes from other agencies
(USGS, Army Corps of Engineers, Census Bureau) and HIFLD brings it together and
provides it in a trustworthy, central place. Well, I should say "provided"
because in September the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/">government stopped providing it</a>. The story is well
told in this good <a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data">article on Project Geospatial</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers immediately
scooped up the data and kept in temporary storage. Then they organized a bucket
brigade of volunteers to categorize and put <a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open">snapshots</a> into long-term storage.
Importantly, this was coupled with metadata to ensure they're findable later.
That's the part I worked on, uploading and entering metadata. We met our goal of
getting all of HIFLD "rescued" by year's end. <a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524">Frank Donnelly</a>, the project
manager, wrote up a nice <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/">summary</a> of what we did and how. For my piece I relied
on a nice Selenium driver, written by another volunteer, to create over a
hundred projects (<a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs">screen recording</a>).</p>
<p>This is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/">tracker</a> to see the
breadth of work.</p>
<p>While I'm proud of this project, I keep reminding myself that we're playing
defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having the
government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding better
leadership and a return to effective government. Assert your rights and
<a href="https://www.nokings.org/">protest</a>!   ❌ 👑.</p>
