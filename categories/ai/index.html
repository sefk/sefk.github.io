<p>It's been nice having AI tools at the ready to take care of cleanup work. You
know, those kind tasks that require a little program or script. Sure you can
write it yourself, but it won't be fun, and it'll take some time, so instead you
just don't bother and it doesn't get done.</p>
<p>Instead of just knocking this out I decided this would be a fun one to try with
the two tools I'm using the most these days, <strong>Gemini</strong> and <strong>Claude</strong>. I can't
really call this a proper bakeoff, since it's just those two and it's not an
especially hard task.</p>
<p><strong>And the result? Both did well but Gemini did a little better.</strong> Gemini got it
right on the first try; Claude had two bugs that were easy to find and fix.
Claude was a little nicer to work with and produced a nicer description of the
solution. Aside from that, the end product was identical.</p>
<h3>The Task</h3>
<p>I wanted to clean up the some of the old files backing this blog. I migrated the
site from Wordpress to Nikola in 2013. Even back then I <a href="../../posts/switching-to-static.md">complained
about</a> the crufty file format, but couldn't be
bothered to fix it then.</p>
<p>The prompt describes in a fair bit of detail what I wanted done. Probably too
much detail. It's down at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>The best way to see what they did is to just look at the resulting commits:
<a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/4a91a57dc965b1e77c05fafbc05fa14f1a293c7f">Gemini</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/78cee0789d98677c5298df543e895d7e2002ff72">Claude</a>. They're pretty similar. I asked both to save
their work in a <code>migration_scripts</code> subdirectory, including a it's own summary
of the work and full log.</p>
<p>For both tools I pay the $20/month that gives me access to reasonable token
limits and good production models -- Gemini 3 and Sonnet 4.6.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Claude</h3>
<p>I didn't describe the problem as "Wordpress-style naming" but Claude sussed that
out. Honestly I'd forgotten that was the source of the problem. Nice!</p>
<p>I like that Claude inserted comments in the configuration file without being
asked to.</p>
<p>Despite being told to test, there were two bugs that I had to find.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of redirects broken. I pointed the problem out and it did more thorough
  testing using <code>curl</code> and found the problem. The new format was what Gemini
  came up with in the first pass (luck? smarts?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A missing newline between the metadata and the body caused the hero images
  to be dropped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="side by side view showing bug" src="../../f/cleanup-missing-hero.png"></p>
<h3>Thoughts on Gemini</h3>
<p>I haven't used the Gemini CLI as much by this point. It seems to have borrowed
much of it's UI and flow from Claude code (slash commands, asking questions as
it goes) so it's familiar. It's really nice to use, just a smidgen less mature
and polished than Gemini.</p>
<p>I preferred Claude's writeup a little so I went with that one. But Gemini wins
the prize for nailing the task on the first try!</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>I really liked how Claude shows how much of it's context window is used via the
<code>/context</code> command. I had a harder time getting this kind of thing out of
Gemini, and even when I did it was harder to grok.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell with either if I'm getting close to any global usage limits. I
should hope not, this wasn't a very big job.</p>
<h5>Claude <code>/context</code> Output</h5>
<p><img alt="Claude context window usage" src="../../f/claude-context.png"></p>
<h5>Gemini <code>/stats model</code> Output</h5>
<p><img alt='Gemini "stats for nerds"' src="../../f/gemini-context.png"></p>
<h3>Prompt</h3>
<p>Both started with this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">First read DEV.md for context about this web site.

In the posts subdirectory are many files that follow an old 
naming convention.  Please convert them all to the new file
naming convention.

The old convention has files of the format YYYYMM&lt;slug&gt;.SUFFIX,
where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and SUFFIX is html or
meta. &lt;slug&gt; is the short form of the the title, and should match
the "slug" field in the metadata

To convert to the new convention

1. Drop the YYYYMM file prefix

2. Combine the "html" and "meta" files into one markdown file
   with a "md" suffix. The contents of "meta" are at the top of
   the file as an HTML comment

3. Add redirects so the old names can still be served. Add tuples
   in the REDIRECTIONS of conf.py

Use the `nikola build` and `nikola serve` commands to test your
work. Make sure all old URL's still function. Make sure pages
look the same. Make sure tags still work.

Do not commit changes. Do not push to production.
</pre></div>

<p>I also checked in a <a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/blob/dev/DEV.md"><code>DEV.md</code></a> file that described the purpose, directory
layout, and some constraints. Again, maybe overkill, but I figured this isn't
the last time I'll be asking one of these tools to help me futz with this site.</p>

    <p>This is a story about my recent experience Vibe Coding. The work itself isn't
impressive and this writeup isn't different than the many gee-whiz posts you see
these days. I didn't do <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116014270900193494">three apps in a day</a>. But I wanted to write up my
experience, mostly to give me an excuse to tell an old tyme programming story
from the 1900's.</p>

<h3>Today, 2026</h3>
<p>While I'm <a href="../../posts/leaving-google/">on a break</a> I'm taking a <a href="https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/detail/20252_TECH-42">Vibe Coding class</a>. It's a fun excuse to
play with some new toys, and it's well taught, and I like doing things with my
friend Jane.</p>
<p>One interesting tidbit: the first day of class, February 3, 2026, was one year
and one day after "vibe coding" itself was coined via <a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en">tweet</a>. That name seems
to have stuck, for the time being at least. On <a href="https://atp.fm/678">last week's ATP</a> they said that
by this time next year this will probably just be called "coding" and I bet
they're right.</p>
<p>Anyway our week one assignment was to code up a game. <strong>In about two hours and
$10</strong> I had a something up and running. I spent another couple of hours futzing
with version control, documentation, and hosting. But that's it! </p>
<p>It's pretty basic, and not all that much fun, but you can <a href="../../daleks">play it here</a>. It's
hosted on Github pages, just like this blog. The code and construction notes are
in <a href="https://github.com/sefk/daleks">checked in</a>.</p>
<p>This was my first experience with <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit</a>. It's impressive and fun. This was
what was recommended for the class and the good folks at Replit were nice enough
to give us all $30 in credits, which I had plenty to spare. Most of my comrades
presented apps that were fancier than mind with 3d graphics, sound, and more
interactive game play. some also said though that they ended up spending much
more than I did, so YMMV on costs.</p>
<p>One interesting part was dealing with integration. To get their code deployed
onto my personal website site required wiring up a GitHub workflow, which I'd
never done before. No problem, Replit took care of that too. Then I asked
<a href="https://geminicli.com/">Gemini</a> to get local hosting running. When I hit a permissions problem and a
crash I had to resist the urge to copy paste the error messages into a search
boxes and Stack Overflow, like I've done for years. Instead I asked Gemini to
debug and sort this out for itself and it did straight away. Pretty great.</p>

<h3>Forty Years Ago, 1985</h3>
<p>Why'd I pick this weird old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_%28BSD_game%29">chase game</a>? Well, that's the more fun and
nostalgic part of the story.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen years old, I spent the summer hand-coding a video game. I'd
gone to a family gathering and my older cousin Erik brought his Mac from
college. It was the first I'd seen a Mac and fell in love. I thought the
Daleks game he had running on it was so cool. The screenshot on the right
is from that Classic Mac website of that game that I found online, and is
exactly how I remember it looked.</p>
<p>Upon return to Fresno I got to work. I spent most of the rest of that summer
writing a clone of Daleks on my Apple //e. All hand-coded 6502 opcodes and twos
complement math for branch offsets by hand (I didn't have an assembler), in
pencil on graph paper. The hardest part was getting smooth animation working,
since the Apple //e "hi res" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics">graphics system</a> was super quirky.</p>
<p>It took about two months to get it working. It's the first time I can remember
being in a flow state and I loved it. It was my first "real program" and began
my lifelong love of computers.</p>
