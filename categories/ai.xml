The work itself isn't
impressive and this writeup isn't different than the many gee-whiz posts you see
these days. I didn't do &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116014270900193494"&gt;three apps in a day&lt;/a&gt;. But I wanted to write up my
experience, mostly to give me an excuse to tell an old tyme programming story
from the 1900's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Today, 2026&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/"&gt;on a break&lt;/a&gt; I'm taking a &lt;a href="https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/detail/20252_TECH-42"&gt;Vibe Coding class&lt;/a&gt;. It's a fun excuse to
play with some new toys, and it's well taught, and I like doing things with my
friend Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting tidbit: the first day of class, February 3, 2026, was one year
and one day after "vibe coding" itself was coined via &lt;a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. That name seems
to have stuck, for the time being at least. On &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/678"&gt;last week's ATP&lt;/a&gt; they said that
by this time next year this will probably just be called "coding" and I bet
they're right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway our week one assignment was to code up a game. &lt;strong&gt;In about two hours and
$10&lt;/strong&gt; I had a something up and running. I spent another couple of hours futzing
with version control, documentation, and hosting. But that's it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty basic, and not all that much fun, but you can &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/daleks"&gt;play it here&lt;/a&gt;. It's
hosted on Github pages, just like this blog. The code and construction notes are
in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/daleks"&gt;checked in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first experience with &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;Replit&lt;/a&gt;. It's impressive and fun. This was
what was recommended for the class and the good folks at Replit were nice enough
to give us all $30 in credits, which I had plenty to spare. Most of my comrades
presented apps that were fancier than mind with 3d graphics, sound, and more
interactive game play. some also said though that they ended up spending much
more than I did, so YMMV on costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting part was dealing with integration. To get their code deployed
onto my personal website site required wiring up a GitHub workflow, which I'd
never done before. No problem, Replit took care of that too. Then I asked
&lt;a href="https://geminicli.com/"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to get local hosting running. When I hit a permissions problem and a
crash I had to resist the urge to copy paste the error messages into a search
boxes and Stack Overflow, like I've done for years. Instead I asked Gemini to
debug and sort this out for itself and it did straight away. Pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forty Years Ago, 1985&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why'd I pick this weird old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_%28BSD_game%29"&gt;chase game&lt;/a&gt;? Well, that's the more fun and
nostalgic part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fourteen years old, I spent the summer hand-coding a video game. I'd
gone to a family gathering and my older cousin Erik brought his Mac from
college. It was the first I'd seen a Mac and fell in love. I thought the
Daleks game he had running on it was so cool. The screenshot on the right
is from that Classic Mac website of that game that I found online, and is
exactly how I remember it looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon return to Fresno I got to work. I spent most of the rest of that summer
writing a clone of Daleks on my Apple //e. All hand-coded 6502 opcodes and twos
complement math for branch offsets by hand (I didn't have an assembler), in
pencil on graph paper. The hardest part was getting smooth animation working,
since the Apple //e "hi res" &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics"&gt;graphics system&lt;/a&gt; was super quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took about two months to get it working. It's the first time I can remember
being in a flow state and I loved it. It was my first "real program" and began
my lifelong love of computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>AI</category><category>Tech</category><category>War Stories</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/daleks/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
