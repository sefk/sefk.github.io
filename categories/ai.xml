&lt;p&gt;This week I used Claude as my pipeline engineer and data analyst. I had a ton of
fun and figured I'd write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been taking a Data Visualization class at Stanford Continuing Studies (TECH
26, Winter 2026). I needed a final project. There's this data set I've always
wanted to play with, &lt;a href="https://data.gesis.org/tweetskb/"&gt;TweetsKB&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers took the Twitter Firehose
data from 2013-23, back when it was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/10rj691/twitter_will_remove_free_access_to_the_twitter/"&gt;more available&lt;/a&gt;, and ran it through entity extraction and sentiment analysis.
They made the dataset available for others to work with. It's well documented
and reasonable size, about 500GB. I figured there'd be something interesting in
there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool part didn't turn out to be the analysis itself. I did find and graph
some trends, like Wordle hitting the scene in Feb 2022 and then falling off;
contrast that with K-Pop, which we all know has been much more durable. You can
see those in the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1foF5n95BJadZ3fQEziQO697c3KwIVdSr7Vd2XcmAElg/edit"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; I did for the class, and I included some charts
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was fun was my week of AI coding data analytics, a joyful week of AI data abalytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What I (We) Did&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I spent the week doing was chatting with Claude interspersed with running
pipelines, bringing up and down jobs, etc. What it felt like though was having
my own junior engineer working hard for me, doing whatever I asked, and doing it
well and without complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is a bit of nuts and bolts of how that went, skippable if you don't
want the blow-by-blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with &lt;strong&gt;ETL pipelines&lt;/strong&gt;. File format conversion, multiprocessing,
scaling to fit RAM and processor limitations, progress bars and
interruption/restart logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes, this is full of offensive stuff! I &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/blob/main/session_prompts.md#14-2026-02-24-0130-utc"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;redaction&lt;/strong&gt; with
stable terms and it found and used a nice &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/better-profanity/"&gt;off-the-shelf library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I didn't trust what I was seeing, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/blob/main/session_prompts.md#64-2026-02-25-1158-utc"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;end-to-end data
quality tests&lt;/strong&gt;. Claude wrote them and then found and fixed a double counting
bug. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wanted to wander around in the data I &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/blob/main/session_prompts.md#21-2026-02-24-1559-utc"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; for an &lt;strong&gt;EDA
dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; and got one. EDA is the term of art I learned in class, "exploratory
data analytics". The idea is something where you can click around, slice and
scrub, looking for interesting things like correlations and trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see this in the screenshot at the top of this post. Essentially I got
the "Overview" and "Slice by Entity" tabs in one shot. How you do EDA with it?
For example, the default view are two base ball teams. See the peaks when the
Red Sox won championships in 2013 and 2018? But the Astros peak was higher in
2017, presumably because of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal"&gt;scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then iterated on that dashboard quite a bit. Instead of a normal notebook or
colab-style workflow I was used to, instead I iterated around the dashboard. I'd
ask Claude add or update charts in the dashboard ("annualize the last data
point"), it'd reload, test and repeat. I did fall back to python or a notebook
when I had to look at the raw data, but just in throwaway mode. I found this to
be a really fast way to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I still had a hard time finding someting interesting in the dataset. So I
just &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/blob/main/session_prompts.md#110-2026-02-26-0009-utc"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; an open-ended question, basically "&lt;strong&gt;find interesting stuff&lt;/strong&gt;"
and it produced &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/tree/main/analysis"&gt;five analysis scripts&lt;/a&gt;. Most of what's in the "Analysis" came
from this one query, except for "Democrats vs. Republicans", which I did on my
own and didn't prove too insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, when I had ops issues Claude fixed those for me too, see screenshot
below. Sure, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; tune workers vs. threads and manage PID files, but who
wants to? And yes, when it came time to write the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1foF5n95BJadZ3fQEziQO697c3KwIVdSr7Vd2XcmAElg/edit"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Claude wrote
that for me too. Well, most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can play with the &lt;a href="http://home.kloninger.com:8050/?tab=analysis"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; It's hosted on an
underpowered server at my home, so if it doesn't work, try again later. All the
code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis"&gt;in GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and there are &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/issues"&gt;known issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I felt it was helpful to define "personas" to Claude to better
describe the goals of each prompt. Then I started a prompt with "hey dashboard
engineer, I'd like to...". I'm not sure how much that helped, it's tough to
tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's not give AI too much credit. Pulling entity mentions out of tweets is
something that data scientists and journalists have been doing for years. And
this particular dataset probably has been around for a while and might very well
have been used and written about, by undergrads. The story here might very well
not be "gee whiz, looks at how smart AI is" and more "look at how AI has scooped
up and repackaged years of everyone else's work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed of accomplishing these dev/debug tasks was remarkable. I felt like I
had a coworker. And at remarkably low cost, too. This was all using the Claude
$20/month plan. This past week was the time I poked above the token cap. I
happily paid $5 more to keep on going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this programming? I think so, at least it felt that way when I was doing it.
I was very much using the same parts of my brain as when I'm writing all the
code myself. Indeed for years most of us have been "progamming" mostly via
Google and Stack Overflow. It's like that but fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Charts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three charts that fell out. Again, don't focus so much on the insights
but how these came from a high-level, open ended prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chart of COVID posts and sentiment" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/tweetskb-covid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Chart showing the Crypto bubble" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/tweetskb-crypto.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Two charts showing pop culture moments" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/tweetskb-popculture.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some Screenshots&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe some people would like to see what this looked like when I was doing it.
Here's a screenshot during pipeline development. On the left is Claude adding
some logging; the top right is &lt;code&gt;tail -f&lt;/code&gt; on a log file, and the bottom right
shows the progress bars churning through the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of pipeline development" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/tweetskb-pipeline.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My modest Mac has 8 performance cores, hence 8 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this screenshot is kind of fun. Look at how Claude explained a worker crash
issue that I asked it to debug: "You already flagged it, the UI literally
says..." 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Claude debugging an ops problem" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/tweetskb-ops.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude made the adjustment and saved its suggestions in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/tweetskb-analysis/issues/2"&gt;Github Issue&lt;/a&gt; to look
if I want to look at it again later.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>AI</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/claude-dataviz/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>AI Is Good At Janitorial Work</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/gemini-claude-cleanup/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/gemini-claude-cleanup.png" alt="Claude Code on the left, Gemini on the right" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been nice having AI tools at the ready for cleanup work. You know, those
tasks that require a little program or script. Sure you can write it yourself,
but it won't be fun, and it'll take some time, so instead you just don't bother
and it doesn't get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just knocking this out I decided this would be a fun one to try with
the two tools I'm using the most these days, &lt;strong&gt;Gemini&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Claude&lt;/strong&gt;. I can't
really call this a proper bakeoff, since it's just those two and it's not an
especially hard task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the result? Both did well but Gemini did a little better.&lt;/strong&gt; Gemini got it
right on the first try; Claude had two bugs that were easy to find and fix.
Claude was a little nicer to work with and produced a nicer description of the
solution. Aside from that, the end product was identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to clean up the some of the old files backing this blog. I migrated the
site from Wordpress to Nikola in 2013. Even back then I &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/switching-to-static.md"&gt;complained
about&lt;/a&gt; the crufty file format, but couldn't be
bothered to fix it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prompt describes in a fair bit of detail what I wanted done. Probably too
much detail. It's down at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to see what they did is to just look at the resulting commits:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/4a91a57dc965b1e77c05fafbc05fa14f1a293c7f"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/78cee0789d98677c5298df543e895d7e2002ff72"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;. They're pretty similar. I asked both to save
their work in a &lt;code&gt;migration_scripts&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory, including a it's own summary
of the work and full log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both tools I pay the $20/month that gives me access to reasonable token
limits and good production models -- Gemini 3 and Sonnet 4.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts on Claude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't describe the problem as "Wordpress-style naming" but Claude sussed that
out. Honestly I'd forgotten that was the source of the problem. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that Claude inserted comments in the configuration file without being
asked to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being told to test, there were two bugs that I had to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of redirects broken. I pointed the problem out and it did more thorough
  testing using &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and found the problem. The new format was what Gemini
  came up with in the first pass (luck? smarts?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A missing newline between the metadata and the body caused the hero images
  to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="side by side view showing bug" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/cleanup-missing-hero.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts on Gemini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't used the Gemini CLI as much by this point. It seems to have borrowed
much of it's UI and flow from Claude code (slash commands, asking questions as
it goes) so it's familiar. It's really nice to use, just a smidgen less mature
and polished than Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I preferred Claude's writeup a little so I went with that one. But Gemini wins
the prize for nailing the task on the first try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked how Claude shows how much of it's context window is used via the
&lt;code&gt;/context&lt;/code&gt; command. I had a harder time getting this kind of thing out of
Gemini, and even when I did it was harder to grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't tell with either if I'm getting close to any global usage limits. I
should hope not, this wasn't a very big job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Claude &lt;code&gt;/context&lt;/code&gt; Output&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Claude context window usage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/claude-context.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Gemini &lt;code&gt;/stats model&lt;/code&gt; Output&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Gemini "stats for nerds"' src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/gemini-context.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both started with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;First read DEV.md for context about this web site.

In the posts subdirectory are many files that follow an old 
naming convention.  Please convert them all to the new file
naming convention.

The old convention has files of the format YYYYMM&amp;lt;slug&amp;gt;.SUFFIX,
where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and SUFFIX is html or
meta. &amp;lt;slug&amp;gt; is the short form of the the title, and should match
the "slug" field in the metadata

To convert to the new convention

1. Drop the YYYYMM file prefix

2. Combine the "html" and "meta" files into one markdown file
   with a "md" suffix. The contents of "meta" are at the top of
   the file as an HTML comment

3. Add redirects so the old names can still be served. Add tuples
   in the REDIRECTIONS of conf.py

Use the `nikola build` and `nikola serve` commands to test your
work. Make sure all old URL's still function. Make sure pages
look the same. Make sure tags still work.

Do not commit changes. Do not push to production.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also checked in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/blob/dev/DEV.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEV.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file that described the purpose, directory
layout, and some constraints. Again, maybe overkill, but I figured this isn't
the last time I'll be asking one of these tools to help me futz with this site.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>AI</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/gemini-claude-cleanup/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Yeah, I Did Some Vibe Coding Too</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/daleks/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a story about my recent experience Vibe Coding. The work itself isn't
impressive and this writeup isn't different than the many gee-whiz posts you see
these days. I didn't do &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116014270900193494"&gt;three apps in a day&lt;/a&gt;. But I wanted to write up my
experience, mostly to give me an excuse to tell an old tyme programming story
from the 1900's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/daleks"&gt;
&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/daleks-2026.png" alt="Screenshot of my recent Daleks game" width="50%"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Today, 2026&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/"&gt;on a break&lt;/a&gt; I'm taking a &lt;a href="https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/detail/20252_TECH-42"&gt;Vibe Coding class&lt;/a&gt;. It's a fun excuse to
play with some new toys, and it's well taught, and I like doing things with my
friend Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting tidbit: the first day of class, February 3, 2026, was one year
and one day after "vibe coding" itself was coined via &lt;a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. That name seems
to have stuck, for the time being at least. On &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/678"&gt;last week's ATP&lt;/a&gt; they said that
by this time next year this will probably just be called "coding" and I bet
they're right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway our week one assignment was to code up a game. &lt;strong&gt;In about two hours and
$10&lt;/strong&gt; I had a something up and running. I spent another couple of hours futzing
with version control, documentation, and hosting. But that's it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty basic, and not all that much fun, but you can &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/daleks"&gt;play it here&lt;/a&gt;. It's
hosted on Github pages, just like this blog. The code and construction notes are
in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/daleks"&gt;checked in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first experience with &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;Replit&lt;/a&gt;. It's impressive and fun. This was
what was recommended for the class and the good folks at Replit were nice enough
to give us all $30 in credits, which I had plenty to spare. Most of my comrades
presented apps that were fancier than mind with 3d graphics, sound, and more
interactive game play. some also said though that they ended up spending much
more than I did, so YMMV on costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting part was dealing with integration. To get their code deployed
onto my personal website site required wiring up a GitHub workflow, which I'd
never done before. No problem, Replit took care of that too. Then I asked
&lt;a href="https://geminicli.com/"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to get local hosting running. When I hit a permissions problem and a
crash I had to resist the urge to copy paste the error messages into a search
boxes and Stack Overflow, like I've done for years. Instead I asked Gemini to
debug and sort this out for itself and it did straight away. Pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/3913-daleks"&gt;
&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/daleks-1984.jpeg" alt="Original Daleks game from 1984" width="45%"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forty Years Ago, 1985&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why'd I pick this weird old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_%28BSD_game%29"&gt;chase game&lt;/a&gt;? Well, that's the more fun and
nostalgic part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fourteen years old, I spent the summer hand-coding a video game. I'd
gone to a family gathering and my older cousin Erik brought his Mac from
college. It was the first I'd seen a Mac and fell in love. I thought the
Daleks game he had running on it was so cool. The screenshot on the right
is from that Classic Mac website of that game that I found online, and is
exactly how I remember it looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon return to Fresno I got to work. I spent most of the rest of that summer
writing a clone of Daleks on my Apple //e. All hand-coded 6502 opcodes and twos
complement math for branch offsets by hand (I didn't have an assembler), in
pencil on graph paper. The hardest part was getting smooth animation working,
since the Apple //e "hi res" &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics"&gt;graphics system&lt;/a&gt; was super quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took about two months to get it working. It's the first time I can remember
being in a flow state and I loved it. It was my first "real program" and began
my lifelong love of computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>AI</category><category>Tech</category><category>War Stories</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/daleks/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
