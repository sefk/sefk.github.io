&lt;p&gt;I was so disappointed in Oppenheimer. It wasn't terrible, but what
a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mystifying&lt;/strong&gt;. Part of the job of a movie like this is to give you
insight into what the person is thinking and feeling.  Especially
in this case -- what would it be like to be the person who made
these terrible weapons? That's really what I wanted to get from
this movie.  I understand he's complicated, and &lt;em&gt;it's&lt;/em&gt; complicated.
But instead of dialog, or even some outright explaining, this movie
leans on of Cillian Murphy staring into the distance or adjusting his hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women&lt;/strong&gt;. There were plenty of interesting women around  -- in
academia, in the Manhattan project, in relationships. There are
only two women in the movie: one is a sex object with mental health
issues (Pugh); the other is a mother/lush with a surprisingly sharp
tongue and wit, but only for a minute (Blunt). The sex scene, quoting
Oppenheimer's most famous line, was gratuitous and super weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strauss&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm not invested at all in the conflict with Admiral
Strauss. Paraphrasing the commentary on this by the good folks at
&lt;a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/703/"&gt;The Incomparable&lt;/a&gt;, "I don't care if some guy becomes Commerce
Secretary in Eisenhower Cabinet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how much I like the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1451677618"&gt;history and the science&lt;/a&gt; of this
period, I really pulling for this movie. Dang.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/oppenheimer/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Feb 2024 21:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
