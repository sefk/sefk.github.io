<p>When I have to tell someone no, I pick up the phone. I <strong>hate</strong>
talking on the phone, but I do it anyway.</p>
<p>When you're answering no to someone, you're disappointing them even
if just a little bit. So you owe it to them to talk instead of
sending an email. It's the polite thing to do.</p>
<p>But there are two other reasons, selfish reasons, for making the
call. First, you get immediate feedback on how they took the news.
If they're upset then you can do damage control straight away. And
at least you know! And second, delivering bad news directly and
respectfully is an important skill to develop. We can all use the
practice. And it's never as bad as I think it will be.</p>

<p>Three days ago I was hobbling around on a sore knee with a torn
meniscus. But after just three days of icing and Ibuprofen and
resting on the couch already my knee is almost better than it was
before. This arthroscopic surgery stuff is amazing.</p>
<p>My knee had been getting progressively worse for the past few months.
But the clincher was six weeks ago, when I was chasing around a dog that
was loose in our front yard. A twist, pop, and I was down. The doctor
I saw the next day confirmed that it wasn't anything "serious" like a
torn ligament, but something was definitely wrong. When we went up to
a week of family camping a few weeks back, I couldn't go on any hikes
and could barely play ping pong. It was a real bummer.</p>
<p>So I met with a sports medicine doctor at Palo Alto Medical Foundation
and got an MRI. He saw a few things wrong in there. A few days later, I
was getting the procedure done. Viola. </p>
<p>Afterwards I was surprised that it didn't hurt. They did prescribe
some pain medication (Hydrocodone plus Acetaminophen) that I've
been taking when I go to bed, but haven't needed during the day.
I've been using a <a href="http://www.djoglobal.com/products/donjoy/donjoy-iceman-clear3">machine that pumps ice water through a pad</a>
around my knee all day to keep it cool, and that's worked really
well. <strong>So much better</strong> than ice packs. Totally recommend the ice
machine.</p>
<p>Thanks to the good surgical team at <a href="http://www.pamf.org/sports/">Palo Alto Medical Foundation</a>
especially <a href="https://www.sutterhealth.org/find-provider/dr-colin-l-eakin-1046233844">Dr. Colin Eakin</a>. Their surgery center on Willow Road
made the whole experience smooth and reassuring. </p>
<p>But one pro tip for you out there considering this. Don't read the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia">wikipedia article on General Anesthesia</a> the night before
surgery. It's crazy stuff. Especially the parts about how we're
still not really sure how it works, or the part about how the level
of anesthesia where it is safe to operate is right between "excitement"
where you vomit and twitch, and "overdose" where you stop breathing.
Don't read that part.</p>
<p>I'm back to work tomorrow, and I expect to be back on my bike by next
week!</p>

<p>I often wake up with a song going through my head. I don't know
why this happens. The stranger thing the songs. Yesterday
was good, I woke up to Led Zepplin's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjlJBmwF3PI">Immigrant Song</a> —
what a great way to start the day. But earlier in the week it was
inexplicably the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiQzUEc_FmI">Golden Girls Theme Song</a>. Gah!</p>
<p>I've heard them called earworms: songs that get stuck in your head and
don't get out. So I'll share with you now the antidote, taught to
me by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jinpa1345">Jane Manning</a>.  Thanks, Jane!</p>
<p><strong>Sing David Bowie's song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VrqCBsbeuc">John, I'm Only Dancing</a>.</strong>
Not one of Bowie's better known songs, nor even one of his best, but
remarkably well suited to this. I believe it's because the
melody is kind of odd and not all that pleasant, so it's not going
to get stuck itself. You kind of remember the melody and lyrics,
but not quite, so that keeps you busy. It always does the trick. </p>

<p>I really don't like tipping. I'm not like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-qV9wVGb38">Mr. Pink</a>. It's
not that I don't want my server or driver to get something extra.
I just don't like the awkward social situation of deciding if this
is a tipping situation, and if so, how much.</p>
<p>Two services have come up recently where I will happily pay a premium
to not have to fret about too much or too little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uber</strong>. Lots to like about this service but the act of just 
  leaving out of my cab without paying is joyful. I always rate 
  my drivers, good or bad. 98% of the time, it's good by the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OrderAhead</strong>. Are you supposed to tip when picking up takeout 
  from a restaurant? I've never known. Neither way feels right, so 
  I usually end up splitting the difference and rounding up to 
  some amount, say leaving a 6% tip, which is the <em>worst</em> choice. 
  Either that's 6% that wasn't expected, or I'm inadvertently
  shafting someone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these services decouple feedback from money. Both avoid
awkwardly changing money. I'd definitely pay a premium for that.</p>
<p>I wonder what other service business would benefit from decoupling
feedback from money?</p>

<p>My family hasn't avoided the colds that are going around now. My
way of fighting back is making chicken noodle soup.  It's not too
hard, it's satisfying, and it tastes great. <a href="../../f/chicken_soup.pdf">The recipe</a> belongs
to <a href="http://peninsulaschool.org/">Peninsula School</a> and gets used at our annual Craft Fair.
It's benefited from years of refinement.</p>
<p>I add more salt. I don't do peas. I've tried with rice but it
got starchy and weird, stick with egg noodles.</p>
