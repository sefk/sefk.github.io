<p>I was fortunate to have had a talk and meal with Rob Reiner some years back. I
wanted to take a moment to share this story on the sad occasion of his death
this week.</p>
<p>It was 2003 or so. I lived and worked for Akamai in Boston.  I went back and
forth to our San Mateo office. There was a red eye from San Jose to Boston that
I'd take home. Back then the San Jose airport was smaller than it is now, and
was especially quiet at the evenings. Flight curfews meant not many flights left
that time of night which means not a lot of dinner options. So McDonald's it
was.</p>
<p>Rob Reiner was in line right in front of me! He was traveling with some
assistant-type person. I tend to not want to bother celebrities in public, but I
was moved to say something.</p>
<p><strong>Sef</strong>: Hello Mr. Reiner. Forgive me but I just wanted to say how much I enjoy
your work. I'm a really big fan.</p>
<p>He has this big grin and offers his hand.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: Hi! What's your name? Thanks for introducing yourself. What have
I done that you liked?</p>
<p>I don't think this was some admission question, I think he genuinely just wanted
to know. And I know his films pretty well at this point. <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>
is his most popular work, but what most people would probably answer would be <em>A
Few Good Men</em>. That had been up for Best Picture ten years prior.</p>
<p><strong>Sef</strong>: <em>The Princess Bride</em>, hands down. I love the story and I love what you
did with it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: I'm glad you said that. That's my favorite too.</p>
<p>I got what I was hoping for at this point. I thanked him and started to beg off
to give him space to order his burger and have dinner in peace. But no. In that
loud, New Yorker voice, he said "C'mon, let's have cheeseburgers!" and offered
me a seat at a table. How could I say no? The three of us all sat.</p>
<p>We had a nice talk over dinner. He asked questions and seemed genuinely
interested in what I did -- work, family. But the highlight was toward the end.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: What else can I answer for you?</p>
<p><strong>Sef</strong>: What would you tell someone early in their career?</p>
<p>At this point I was about thirty years old, so hardly <em>that</em> early in my own
career, but I was asking in a genuine way. He answered straight away.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: <mark>Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every
day.</mark> Me, I like writing so I try to do that of it every day if I can. 
That's how you get good.</p>
<p>then told a few stories about he meets people who don't do this. I guess when
you're someone like him people asking you frequently for jobs or if you'd
produce their movie or whatnot. He said that he'd ask them what was the last
thing they'd written, or what they were working on now, or what'd they'd written
today. And he could tell if they did it often and did it for fun. If it was a
chore and a burden that was a bad sign.</p>
<p>(BTW, I've used this when hiring people who are even the least bit technical,
even managers. I ask them to write some code, even just a little bit. Do they
relish or dread it? Does it seem like they've done it recently? You can tell a
lot from how they react, which is more important than the answer itself.)</p>
<p>I was struck by what a nice and interesting, and interested, person Rob Reiner
was. It was incredibly generous for him to spend time with a fanboy when he
could be off duty and just enjoying his cheeseburger. What a gem.</p>

<p>I liked the question that I got when interviewing at YouTube in 2015. At Google
then we'd have an interview panel of four or five people, each assigned to cover
a different area. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billy-biggs-7ab1023/">Billy Biggs</a> was the TL on my panel asked to evaluate
"architecture." For a manager candidate that mostly meant evaluating technical
cluefulness (someone else had me do some simple <a href="../../posts/201205fizzbuzz-for-managers">programming</a>).</p>
<p>Billy's question: <strong>Discuss what would cause a Python interpreter to crash. Not
a <em>program written in Python</em>, but the interpreter itself.</strong></p>
<p>I remember this leading to a fun, rambling, back-and-forth discussion of the
<strong>ways computers can fail</strong>. There are so many! Every level of the stack can
fail in interesting ways: storage, RAM, memory management, networking. How would
a bit flip in a TLB manifest? How does TCP/IP detect and handle ordering?
collisions?</p>
<p>We also covered a bunch of <strong>engineering and process questions</strong>. How is the
interpreter itself implemented, in what language and by whom? What would the
quality processes be like for a product like that, especially given Python is
presumably a really large open source project? How would you manage this? How
important to quality is the role of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">BDFL</a>? </p>
<p>And then that lead to a some more interesting higher-level discussions about the
actual <strong>costs and benefits of addressing failures</strong> like these in the field.
When should programs hard-fail versus detect and recover? How would you staff an
engineering team to find and chase down errors? What's the user impact to a
failure like this?</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about this question is most likely it was something
they'd actually seen right in their backyard. In 2015 significant parts of
YouTube was <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-December/070323.html">written in Python</a> (that's likely not the case anymore, I don't
know). Crashes like these must have come up in the field. Not only are
real-world problems relatively easy to ask, but they have the added benefit of
showing the candidate the kinds of issues that the team actually deals with. It's
also a well-shaped question: open ended, no right/wrong answers.</p>
<p>I got the job.</p>

<p><em>What's the value of an experiment or a prototype?</em></p>
<p>There are all kinds of ways to have impact. A feature can improve user
experience; a hardening project can reduce risk of a production outage;
refactoring or test coverage can improve velocity or make software easier and
safer to maintain. And good engineers care a lot about impact. While it's not
the only thing that matters (the "how" is important too), if you start with
impact, you'll generally do well.</p>
<p>An engineer's job to put ideas into practice, to make things. But sometimes
we're not sure what to make. Or we think we know, but aren't sure it'll work.
The best way to figure that out is often running a set of experiments, or maybe
building a prototype (an n=1 experiment).</p>
<p>But crucially, an experiment doesn't have value itself. An experiment is
successful only if we've learned something. The intent of the test rig or
prototype isn't to live on. Indeed, knowing that we plan to throw it away is
part of what makes it fast and cheap to build, and it shouldn't have all the
trappings of production-quality software, like test coverage and code reviews.</p>
<p>So how do we ensure that value gets delivered? When you work in a team or a
company people turn over. It's not just enough to do the experiment, you need to
write it up and share your results. To produce a good writeup, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Figure out the hypothesis(es)</strong> you're testing. Often this is in the form
   of one or more questions. For prototypes, it might be a boolean, i.e. we can
   build X that will work. But even then, consider what "done" means. Stating
   your hypothesis in terms of a metric is often easiest. NB I find the
   goal/driver/guardrail framework from Thanks <a href="https://research.google/people/author3770/?&amp;type=google">Diane</a>'s book helpful,
   <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trustworthy_Online_Controlled_Experiment/TFjPDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State your assumptions and method</strong>. This is where you usually get the most
   feedback. Note that this usually isn't a project plan, as your reviewers
   usually don't care how long it takes or what happens when. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek feedback</strong> from your peers. Publish the doc stating the method to have
   smart people poke holes in your plan and make sure what you're measuring will
   actually address the hypothesis. And then when the experiment is done, get it
   reviewed by someone senior to ensure that your work supports your conclusion.
   This also spreads knowledge about this work (both that you're doing it, and
   the results) so the overall organization benefits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The artifact produced has many benefits. It's useful for you as you discuss
follow-on work; it's useful come performance evaluation time. But most
importantly, it benefits the organization. Contemporary and future peers can
learn from this work. </p>
<p>You'll benefit from taking the time to write it up, the reviewers learn from
reading, and it'll live on past your time with the team.</p>

<p>Sponsorship is using your position and influence to help someone get ahead. It's
similar in many ways to mentorship, the topic of my <a href="../../posts/mentoring">last post</a>.
But sponsorship is a bit tricker. Most people understand mentorship
and have good feelings about it. Sponsorship is a bit less familiar and might
even feel a bit unseemly — at least it used to feel that way to me.</p>
<p>Although I'd heard the concept before, a talk <a href="https://www.carlaspearls.com/">Carla Harris</a> gave at Google in
2022 made an impression on me and brought it to the forefront. (She has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE_W50OTUc">2019
TED Talk</a> that hits a lot of the same points). She spoke about the value of
sponsorship, both on the receiving end early in her career and now as a sponsor
herself. More than just her description, what I most appreciated was her candor.
It gave me a permission structure to use this concept myself. I started using it
with junior engineers when thinking about their careers; I thought about it
myself when debugging how some decision played out. It also helped me to think
of it less judgmentally. Now I see it as being thoughtful and pragmatic about
how decisions are made.</p>
<p>So what it it? Sponsoring is similar to mentoring in that it's an investment in
someone, but the mechanism is different. Mentoring is a commitment to
problem-solve issues as they come up, teach skills, and serve as a sounding
board, amongst other things. Sponsoring is more strategic. The sponsor is
committing to understand the sponsored's goals and strengths, and (here's the
important part) help them get ahead. The time commitment isn't as large, but the
<em>actual commitment</em> is greater. Assuming they see eye-to-eye, the sponsor
commits to <em>putting their reputation on the line</em> to help the their person
achieve their goals. Some examples would be vouching for the sponsored during a
staffing conversations or seeking out and advocating for them when opportunities
comes up.</p>
<p>In some ways, sponsorship acknowledges and even co-opts the "you have to know
somebody" way that the world actually works. Underrepresented groups can benefit
from sponsorship as a way to wedge into existing power structures. If that
describes you, consider asking for someone to explicitly sponsor you; if you're
in a traditionally privileged group, consider sponsoring someone who isn't so
much.  My Google peer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-grey-b69319/">Rachel</a> observed: "women are often over-mentored and
under-sponsored."</p>
<h4>Maybe You're Going Up For Promotion</h4>
<p>With this in mind, let's apply this to promotions.</p>
<p>Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias these decisions, they are complicated
and are made by real-world humans. Organizations rely on their senior people to
bring their experience, knowledge, and judgment to bear.</p>
<p>Consider how the promotion decision will be made for your case. One key question
is <strong>who'll be in the room</strong>? This isn't just who is invited and who will
attend, but more who will be <strong>influential</strong> in the discussion and decision
making process, and <strong>for what</strong> kinds of questions. Not everyone has an equal
voice.</p>
<p>Say you're an engineer going up for promotion to senior engineer. Then likely a
senior tech lead (not necessarily <em>your</em> tech lead!) will be asked to speak to
the quality of your work (e.g. good code, considered alternatives,
future-proofing). A senior manager will likely be asked to assess how well you
worked with others and made good decisions. And these are just two of the
factors — there will be many others depending on your role and level. You
need to work down the rubric and think through who'll be asked to attest to each
area as it comes up. Who will be asked to speak to concerns when they're raised
("was that <em>really</em> that hard?")?</p>
<p>Sometimes you might know who the key person will be, but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.</p>
<p>And then assess their level of support. This may be something you can do
yourself (if you have a relationship already) or maybe you'll need your
manager's help. But somehow you need to ask them, as candidly as you can, "If
asked about X, what will you say?" It can sometimes be hard to get an honest
answer, so you may need to push a little. Reassure them you'd much rather know
now if you have their support or not and you're not going to hold it against
them.</p>
<p>If you don't have their support yet, that's OK. Think about work you can do
to change that over time.</p>
<h4>Day-To-Day Decisions</h4>
<p>Not all decisions are as high-stakes as promotions. Leaders make decisions all
the time, like whom to trust to lead a project or run a meeting. I like to think
about these small-but-important decisions too in the context of sponsorship. Is
your manager your sponsor? What about your TL?</p>

<p>So you're looking for a mentor, that's great! I've benefitted a lot
from mentors in my career. It'll be a valuable experience for
both you and your mentor. This post has my tips for finding a good
mentor, asking them, and maintaining a good ongoing relationship.</p>
<h4>Choosing</h4>
<p>These are my three go-to rules for finding a mentor. They've held
up across many companies and years.</p>
<p>1. Your mentor should be <strong>someone you admire</strong>. The best choice
is usually someone the same career path as you, but further along
by some years. They don't have to be so much more senior, it could
just be the next step, but they've shown that they're willing and
able to take on more responsibility and how to do it at your company.
Ideally they're someone interesting, inspirational, and relateable.</p>
<p>Another type of mentoring relationship is when you're looking to
make a change — say from Engineer to Engineering Manager, or
Engineering Manager to Product Manager. Then you're looking for
someone who made the switch. I find they're often the most eager
to talk about how and why they did it.</p>
<p>2. Organizationally close-by is OK, but they <strong>shouldn't be one
of your leaders</strong>. I've gotten the most out of mentors outside my
chain of command. That way, I never had to worry about choosing my
words (or topics) carefully. I could problem solve or just vent.
Sometimes the person you need to discuss is your own
<a href="../../posts/problem-or-solution-boss">boss</a>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Rapport is super important</strong>. Maybe the most important thing
of all. Your meetings can't feel like a chore for either of you.
Even if you've gotten along fine in the past, maybe you'll hit it
off in this new relationship, maybe now.</p>
<p>How can you find the right person if it's not obvious who to ask? Use
your network, talk to people, ask for referrals. Big companies often
have mentoring programs for matchmaking.</p>
<h4>Asking</h4>
<p>While your mentor will benefit a bit, you'll be the one getting the
most out of this deal. So it's up to you to ask. Understand that
they're likely busy, so say how much you'd appreciate some of their
time. Make sure they know it's OK to say no.</p>
<p>I recommend asking for a trial run to start with: "Let's do three
or four meetings and then re-evaluate." That way you can make sure
that it's clicking, see the "rapport" criteria above. If it's not
feeling great <em>on both sides</em> then it's best to try again with
someone else, no harm no foul.</p>
<h4>Being A Good Mentee</h4>
<p>So you've found someone, great. Here's some things you should do
during probation and onward.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Respect their time</strong>. Be prompt. Work around their schedule
and in a way that works best for them (30 min? over a meal?).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Come prepared with a topic or two</strong>, keep a backlog. It can
be something specific, like problem solving a particular situation
or relationship. Or it could be getting just-in-time feedback on a
draft email or document. Or it could be open-ended, e.g. "if you
could advise your former self 10 years ago, what would you have
said?"</p>
<p>3. <strong>Check in</strong> from time to time. Make sure this is still working
out for them: the style of meeting, duration, etc.</p>
<p>4. Find an appropriate way to <strong>thank them</strong>. Nothing big but it's
important to show that you appreciate their time. For example at
my current employer (Google) we have a system to give shout-outs
to peers that come up at performance review time.</p>
<p>Finally, find a way to <strong>pay it forward</strong>. Introduce mentors and
mentees; volunteer in your company's matchmaking service; find
people who appear to stranded and offer to help them out. Sending
this post might be a fine icebreaker.</p>

<p>Some bosses want you to <em>bring them problems</em>. They like to unscramble
Rubik's cubes and are happy to work through it with you. Sure it's great if you have a proposal or recommendation,
but be prepared to show your homework.</p>
<p>Other bosses want you to <em>bring them solutions</em>. If you
bring them a problem, you'll get annoyance and "what do you want
me to do about it?"</p>
<p>Most bosses have exceptions by domain. A common pattern there is
the bring-me-problems boss who is also a techie -- they'll want to
dig in planning, say, but prefer you to solve messy people conflicts
yourself.</p>
<p>I've worked with both and each has their virtues. When you have a new
boss, figure out their style and adjust.</p>

I've observed a recurring source of tension:  building things fast vs. do it the right way. Usually you're not lucky enough that you can do both.  This post explains a bit why we (engineers) care so much about building things right.  Even when things are overdue and our stakeholders (end-users, biz folks, product management) are pushing to just get it done.


</p>
<p>
You can describe the two poles here in pejorative terms.  Fast is slapdash, quick and dirty, bad software.  The right way is really just ivory-tower over-engineered turd polishing.  Is that fix really so important that we shouldn't ship it? Do you really need to refactor that now?



</p>
<p>
I see three things driving engineers to build it right.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Wrong is insidious</strong>. A story: early on in Class2Go every page began with a fetch of some basic page data. If there was an error on lookup we would throw a 404. Not only is "not found" the wrong message, but it also isn't helpful. It covers up all kinds of other problems, in a way that is really difficult to debug.But for an engineer, these programming messes are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows</a>. Not only do they cheapen the project, they encourage others to take bad shortcuts. Heck, if they can't be bothered to handle exceptions correctly, then why should I?</li>
	<li>
<strong>Wrong is the express train to support hell.</strong> Unless you leave the company or project, you'll be called upon to support your own crappy code. That is certain. And there is almost nothing worse than being dragged back to debug some old code that you never meant to become production, and is now breaking the world.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Wrong hurts your reputation as an engineer</strong>. People see you taking shortcuts and infer that you are a sloppy programmer. And really they aren't wrong to do so. One habit of really good engineers is they don't leave a wake of messes behind them. They are able to do things (mostly) right even when they are moving fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This last point is really the key one. Amongst engineers your reputation is your hard currency. It affects what projects you're invited to work on and what companies you'll be asked to join. Most importantly, good engineers only want to work with other good engineers, and they won't seek out someone sloppy. So I assume that any code I write will be looked at by a potential colleague or employer. This is especially true when working on an open-source project.



</p>
<p>
This doesn't mean you have to go slow -- indeed, on my current project, <a href="http://class2go.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Class2Go</a>, we get a lot done every week. What it does mean is that sometimes I'd rather not do something than do something I know will come out poorly.



</p>
<p>
So, product manager waiting on a feature. What to do if you're waiting on an engineer and you think it's taking too damn long? The tactic **not** to use: tell them this won't matter and to just ship it. That will just piss him off. Better: get your senior engineer to convince the junior one why it's good enough to ship and reason about what really needs to get done. Exception: if the engineer you're waiting on is your senior engineer, then trust her judgment and wait.



</p>
<p>
And finally, to you product managers and biz folks who push. You are right do do so. That's all that matters to the customers, all matters at the end of the day. Keep it up.</p>

Engineering management is about solving problems and removing obstacles. You always have more problems than time and resources to solve them. How can you stay on top of it all?


</p>
<p>
<img class="alignright  wp-image-289" style="border: 0px;" title="to-do-list" src="../../f/to-do-list.jpg" alt="" width="191" height="181"></p>
<p>
A trick I learned from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/austinfish" target="_blank">Julia Austin</a> (my boss at Akamai some years back) was force yourself to always solve two problems at once. Before jumping on today's problem, figure out something else you can fix at the same time.



</p>
<p>
Say you have a retention problem. Engineering department scuttlebutt is that people are burned out with maintenance projects. But you are also concerned about your low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" target="_blank">bus number</a>. I had these two problems once, and my answer was to actively shuffle engineers around onto other projects. Not quite musical chairs, but close. It worked. The engineers liked the variety, and I gave my top performers first dibs on projects, which they appreciated. There was a short-term productivity hit, but it was worth the benefits from cross-pollination and engineer happiness.



</p>
<p>
Another real-life example. I had a remote office that felt disconnected and needed some knowledge-sharing love. I had to send someone over for a few weeks. I initially planned on sending my go-to senior person, but they had had been before and to them an international trip was a chore. Instead I had an up-and-coming engineer who I wanted to invest in. This trip was a stretch for her, but I did some coaching and she did great.  Plus she saw it as a perq and appreciated the responsibility.



</p>
<p>
This technique has driven a couple good behaviors for me as an engineering manager. I try  to take a minute before jumping in with a solution to see what else I can do while I'm at it.  It also has helped me to keep a useful (and secret) worry list and to consult it from time to time. That list is a useful way for <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FourQuadrants">important but not urgent</a> problems to get mindshare. Reviewing that list became part of my Sunday evening get-ready-for-the-week routine.
