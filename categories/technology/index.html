<p>I did a data cleanup over the weekend. I doubt this is interesting
for anyone else, I just wanted to capture my own notes.</p>
<p>Our family photos are stored up in Google Photos. We have about
100k photos and short movies that take up 0.5TB. I wanted to back
up to <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?product_line=ds_plus">local storage</a>, but also I liked the idea of trying the
<a href="https://www.mdisc.com/">mdisc</a> format for long-term storage.</p>
<p>I ran <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Takeout</a> and unzipped everything. I was surprised to see
so many duplicates. Some are copies in the same folders with suffixes
like "(1)", most are multiple copies in different folders.
Takeout seems to just store a copy for each album a photo is in.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10pRVc1_6u0G2z62uEJSHHZ0yzf43Zoa9yx0D2bpICmE/edit?usp=sharing">Some poking at the data</a> shows 88% of 302,755 files / 72% of
the bytes were unique (histogram at the bottom of the post).  Removing
dups can save 200+GB. Sure not really worth the trouble but why
not.</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>1. On the NAS, gather file checksums (<code>md5sum</code>) and sizes for all
the files under <code>Takeout/Google Files</code>. Mostly variations on
of <code>find -print0 | xargs -0</code>.</p>
<p>2. Data cleanup to get into nice file paths and clean delimiters,
mostly interactively with <code>vi</code>.</p>
<p>3. Insert into <code>sqlite</code> using <code>.separator</code> and <code>.import</code>.</p>
<p>Here's what the database ended up looking like: <code>Photos</code> and <code>Sizes</code>
are inputs, <code>HashCounts</code>, <code>Duplicates</code>, and <code>Candidates</code> are
outputs.</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="k">CREATE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">TABLE</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Photos</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hash</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">TEXT</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">TEXT</span><span class="p">);</span>

</pre></div>

<p>4. Find the dups. I'm surprised to find some with 50 or more copies,
but it out some family favorites end up in lots of albums.</p>

<p>I was surprised that sqlplus supports window functions, nice.</p>
<p>The inner reverse-alpha sort on "path" takes care of two cases.
I tend to prefer keeping photos with names that start with
years, and Those come first alphabetically (nice). Also within
folders often there are many copies with "(1)" and "(2)" suffixes
that are generally cruft and most worthy of removing, and those
also sort last alphabetically (nice).</p>
<p>5. Dump out the "Candidates" using <code>.output</code>. Copy back to the NAS.
Do lots of spot checks. Convert to a bash script of <code>rm</code> commands,
run very carefully.</p>
<h4>Tools</h4>
<p><strong>Sqlite</strong> is my go-to tool for ad-hoc work like this.  It's fast
and simple, but only for small jobs -- this one is MB-scale.</p>

<p>My <strong>Synology</strong> is a pretty good place for storage with ability to
ssh in and run local commands.  But if I had to do this again,
though, I should have just bought a large locally-connected SSD.
All the transfers to-from the NAS were a hassle. Looking now I'm
stunned that you can get a 4 TB external SSD for under $300.</p>

<p>If you've traveled internationally, likely you've used a SIM card
for local data and calls. There is a nice ecosystem around SIMs
with a wealth of easy and affordable Pay As You Go (PAYG) options.</p>
<p>But the newer iPhones did away with the SIM slot if favor of some new
eSIM hotness. Apple has all kinds of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209096">info</a> claiming they have good
international support, but I found reality falls short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a few carriers support eSIM's,</li>
<li>The few that do require a contract. A tourist or student
   studying abroad is better served by a PAYG plan, and</li>
<li>Even if you can stomach a contract, that would require a UK bank
   account; no way to easily pull that off.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up falling back to <a href="https://www.att.com/international/day-pass/">international roaming</a>. It works but
is expensive.</p>
<p>I think Apple made the wrong call removing the trusty old SIM tray.
Clearly the new models can be made to work well with it, since how
they are sold in the UK.  If you're unlucky enough to have bought
your recent iPhone in the US, you're out of luck. </p>
<p>I this is an example of Apple bad tendency sometimes choose form
over function, "<a href="https://www.theringer.com/2016/9/7/16038622/why-did-apple-remove-the-headphone-jack-courage">courage</a>" over usability.</p>

<p>I'm excited to start my new job at YouTube in a few weeks. I'll manage the
engineering team building the data warehouse for usage metrics.</p>
<p>I like that YouTube is <strong>important</strong>. It's firmly a part of our culture
and I'm sure it will be how my kids watch video. YouTube's impressive
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html">statistics</a> are the result. You don't see usage like that without a
bunch of <strong>hard problems</strong>, and hard problems attract <strong>bright people</strong>.
Indeed that's the clincher for why I'm looking forward to working there.
People vote with their feet, and I have a lot of friends who have opted
for Google, and YouTube specifically. They tell me that it's a great place
to work.</p>
<p>YouTube is one of the worlds foremost platforms for social commentary,
education, and free speech. And it's plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">entertainment</a> too. Sounds
like fun.</p>

<p>Thick apps won mobile. Fine. </p>
<p>On laptop (and desktop) it's not so clear. What is better, thick or thin?
I tend to live mostly in thin land, although I use some thick apps
regularly, like Twitter's Mac client and Apple Photos.</p>
<p>Every so often I give a big native app a try: <strong>Excel</strong> instead of
<strong>Google Sheets</strong>, <strong>Mail.app</strong> instead of <strong>Gmail</strong>, <strong>Reminders</strong>
instead of the barebones <strong>Tasks</strong> built into Gmail. (I can't bring myself
to try Word). But it's disappointing to see how those fancy apps keep
shooting themselves in the foot!</p>
<p>Take for example this Excel error message. Excel is whining that it
can't verify my subscription the first time I ran Excel untethered
(version 15.11.2, for what its worth). Sure you can click through the
warning, but would a newbie know to do that? At best off-putting, at worst
downright disorienting. Why warn me of this at all? And why in a modal
that stops me dead in my tracks?</p>
<p>It seems thick apps should win. They rock the unplugged use case. An even
better situation is flaky networks -- tethered, conference WiFi,
travelling. UI's deal notoriously poorly with intermittent or partial
outages. A thick client, relying on that connection only for hitting
API's, can hide the network.</p>
<p>Another place they should shine is the UI itself. They should be fast,
beautiful, and featureful. Too often they're not. For example I find
Mail.app to be clunky, difficult to customize, and its keyboard shortcuts
few and poorly done. Gmail is pretty good!</p>
<p>Finally there's the upgrade problem. Thick apps need conscious effort from
their users before their work sees user time and they get feedback. And
that's what drives innovation. Long cycles means slower (less) invention.
One example I love is Gmail's "undo send" feature. Boy, you sure do miss
that when you need it and it's not there! That should be on every thick
client by now, but I don't think it is. I do know that Gmail has it and
Mail.app still doesn't.</p>
<p>Maybe the Internet can help. Look at <strong><a href="https://www.getchrome.com/">Chrome</a></strong> with its awesome auto
updates. What makes this work is solid engineering and exceptional quality
control. I've never seen behind the Google curtain, but I bet there's no
magic, just a lot of good engineering that leads to good software. Like:
good design and code reviews, tons of test coverage across many scenarios,
diverse and well-instrumented canaries, and thorough performance and
resource use testing. If Google didn't all of that so well, then we
wouldn't accept frequent pushes. Without the frequent upgrade cycle,
Chromes feature cycle would languish.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.getelectron.com/">Electron</a></strong> is another bright spot. This is the framework that gives
Slack and GitHub's thick clients their fit and finish. It makes these feel
like true native apps, even though they are mostly web controls with
JavaScript the covers. Right-clicking still doesn't do what I want, and
text controls are finicky, but it's close. But what those rough edges buy
you, and the software producer, are frequent, reliable, and clean
upgrades.</p>
<p>My natural preference would be for thick apps. If they were done well,
I'd use them.</p>

<p>I left <a href="http://www.wavefront.com/">my last job</a> a few weeks back and it's high time to look for a new
one. If you're working on something interesting and think I could help, <a href="mailto:sefklon@gmail.com">let
me know</a>! </p>
<p>It's nice to not have a day job while looking for another. I was lucky enough
to do this <a href="../../posts/201204my-sabbatical.html">once before in 2012</a> which turned out great. I learned then
that time and flexibility lets you talk to lots of friends and learn about a
breadth of projects. I found a fun project in a new domain (<a href="../../posts/201207on-line-education.html">online
education</a>), something I doubt I'd have found the normal way.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll get lucky again.</p>
<p>Enough small talk, what am I looking for?</p>
<p>I'm looking for some flavor of <strong>line manager</strong>. I'm a good senior manager and
code-every-day engineer; but I'm exceptional leading a team and running a
project. That's what line managers do: lead engineers, not other managers or
departments or matrix-anything. Also, if you're some kind of executive then
coding is an indulgence, and I'd rather it just be part of my job. Mostly I'm
talking to <strong>small companies</strong>, say 10-100 people (fun-size).</p>
<p>I want to <strong>build on my experience</strong>. I know infrastructure and cloud, SaaS
and enterprise, and online education. I'm probably not the best person for
your storage, security, gaming, e-commerce, or cryptocurrency company. I want
to stay working on <strong>Internet technology</strong>. I like the (micro)services model.
For my own projects I choose Python, JavaScript (frontend and backend), and
Java. I know web operations, especially the <a href="../../posts/aws.html">Amazon stack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong> is important: I don't want to do a daily Menlo Park to San
Francisco round-trip. I'd like to <strong>work with friends</strong> if possible. And I
want to do something <strong>worthwhile</strong>.</p>
<p>You can always get to my resume from the header here, or via this <a href="http://bit.ly/sef-resume">short
link</a>. I'm open to a bunch of things, just no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgu7jdc_fs">kick boxing</a>.  Let's
have coffee/drink or take a walk.</p>

    <p><img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="../../f/aws.png" alt="AWS Logo" width="30%"></p>
<p>I've spent the last three years building and operating web sites
with Amazon Web Services and here are a few lessons I've learned. 
But I first have to come clean that I'm a fan of AWS with only
casual experience with other IAAS/PAAS platforms.</p>
<p><strong>S3 Is Amazing</strong>. They made the right engineering choices and
compromises: cheap, practically infinitely scalable, fast enough,
with good availability. $0.03/GB/mo covers up for a lot of sins.
Knowing it's there changes how you build systems.</p>
<p><strong>IAM Machine Roles From The Start</strong>. IAM with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata</a>
is a powerful way to manage secrets and rights. Trouble is you can't add
to existing machines. Provision with machine roles in big categories
(e.g. app servers, utility machines, databases) at the start, even if 
just placeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Availability Zoness Are Only Mostly Decoupled</strong>. After the 2011
<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202805/cloud-computing/amazon-ec2-outage-calls--availability-zones--into-question.html">us-east-1 outage</a> we were reassured that a coordinated 
outage wouldn't happen again, but it happened again just
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/2zpag7/aws_internal_dns_outage/">last month</a>.</p>
<p><strong>They Will Lock You In And You'll Like It</strong>. They secondary services
work well, are cheap, and are handy. I'm speaking of SQS, SES,
Glacier, even Elastic Transcoder. Who <em>wants</em> to run a durable queue
again?</p>
<p><strong>CloudFormation No</strong>. It's tough to get right. My
objection isn't programming in YAML, I don't mind writing Ansible plays, it's the
complexity/structure of CloudFormation that is impenetrable. Plus
even if you get it working once, you'd never run it again on something
that is running.</p>
<p><strong>Boto Yes</strong>. Powerful and expressive. Don't script the CLI, use
Boto. Easy as pie.</p>
<p><strong>Qualify Machines Before Use</strong>. Some VMs have lousy networking,
presumably due to a chatty same-host or same-rack neighbor. Test
for loss and latency to other hosts you own and on EBS. (I've used
home-grown scripts, don't know of a standard open-source widget,
someone should write one).</p>
<p><strong>VPC Yes</strong>. If you have machines talking to each other (i.e. not a
lone machine doing something lonely) then put them in a VPC. It's not
hard.</p>
<p><strong>NAT No</strong>. You think that'll improve security, but it will just
introduce SPOFS and capacity chokepoints. Give your machines publicly
routable IP's and use security groups.</p>
<p><strong>Network ACLs Are A Pain</strong>. Try to get as far as you can with just security
groups.</p>
<p><strong>You'll Peer VPC's Someday</strong>. Choose non-overlapping subnet IP ranges
at the start. It's hard to change later.</p>
<p><strong>Spot Instances Are Tricky</strong>. They're only For a very specific use
case that likely isn't yours. Setting up a test network? You can
spend the money you save by using spot on swear jar fees.</p>
<p><strong>Pick a Management Toolset</strong>. Ansible, Chef, all those things aren't
<em>all</em> that different when it comes down to it. Just don't dither back
and forth. There's a little bit of extra Chef love w/ AWS but not enough to tip
the scales in your decision I'd reckon. </p>
<p><strong>Tech Support Is Terrible</strong>. My <a href="http://www.wavefront.com/">last little
startup</a> didn't get much out of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">business level tech
support</a> we bought. We needed it so we could call in to get
help when we needed it, and we used that for escalating some problems.
It was nice to have a number to call when I urgently need to up a
system limit, say. But debugging something real, like a networking
problem? Pretty rough.</p>
<p><strong>...Unless You Are Big</strong>. Stanford, on the other hand, had a named
rep who was responsive and helpful. I guess she was sales, but I
used her freely on support issues and she worked the backchannels
for us. Presumably this is what any big/important customer would
get, that's just not you, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Power Is On Demand</strong>. I'm reaffirming cloud
koolaid here. Running this way lets you build and run systems
differently, <em>much better</em>. I've relied on the cloud this to bring
up emergency capacity. I've used it to convert a class of machines
on the fly to the double-price double-RAM tier when hitting a
surprising capacity crunch. There are a whole class of problems
that get much easier when you can have 2x the machines for just a
little while.  When someone comes to you with that cost/benefit
spreadsheet arguing why you should self-host, that's when you need
your file of "the cloud saved my bacon" stories at the ready.</p>

<p>If I could do my college years over I would focus on writing. I
would take courses that required a lot of writing, in the spirit
of "learn by doing". I'd also take courses in the mechanics and
craft: grammar, vocabulary, and rhetoric.</p>
<p>I used to consider myself a competent writer. And certainly good
enough for an engineer, right? But I've learned that I have a long
way to go. I've learned that engineers spend much more time writing
than you expect. And I appreciate how hard it is to write well.</p>
<p>This came up just this past week. I came across a beautiful four
page essay. It laid out the problem, described alternatives, and
lead you concisely to a well-reasoned conclusion. Sure, it was about
technology, but what carried the day was the good writing. Humbling!</p>
<p>You're saying: but wait, you're a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-Haired_Boss">pointy-haired boss</a> now
Sef, one of those guys who doesn't do <em>Real Work</em> anymore. You write
email and boss people around. I understand why managers like you
need to write, I'm an engineer. I write code. Well, there's some
truth to that. But I'd like to convince you that even monster coders,
if they're any good, write a lot, write well, and value good writing
in others.</p>
<p>It is rare for someone to do their work in isolation and have it
matter. Either you're working as part of a team, in a company or
a community of developers, say on an open-source project. Sure, you
build a great system or feature. But to have it matter to the world,
for others to adopt it, you need to document, publicize, support,
teach. 98% of that is writing.</p>
<p>I had a lunchtime conversation with <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>,
Django's co-founder, at last year's PyCon. I asked him why Django
caught on and was adopted by so many of us (including <a href="http://class2go.stanford.edu/">my last
project</a> and <a href="http://code.edx.org/">my current project</a>). I was expecting him
to point to features or timing. Instead he said it was "because we
wrote good docs". The Django team didn't treat documentation as an
afterthought. They have lots of docs, and they are good.</p>
<p>Consider that rare bird, the iconoclastic engineer working in
isolation on their own project. I'm thinking of <a href="http://antirez.com/">Antirez</a> or
<a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco</a>. (Maybe they aren't even truly on their own so much.
Humor me!) They are prolific and strong coders. But they also write
a lot of words! They write a ton about their project; also tech
landscape and their place in it. Would their software have as much
of an impact if they didn't write so much (and well)? I say no.</p>
<p>Case in point. Both Marco and I wrote blog posts riffing off the
same topic two weeks ago. First, read <a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/posts/consume-produce-public.html">mine</a>, then
<a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/01/03/the-builders-high">his</a>.  It takes me a ton of words to get something
basic out.  His is concise and clear. Sheesh.</p>
<p>So kids, don't shortchange those liberal arts classes. It's not
fluffy stuff on the side. <strong>That is core</strong>. You need to write well
to be a good engineer.</p>
<p>Protip: the best way to do this is to major in the humanities. They
write like crazy over there. Be like my friend Dan Chu and major
in history, but secretly take CS courses on the side. If you're
super smart like him, and can manage getting both degrees, then
you're awesome. But don't sacrifice the BA for the BS. I would
<strong>love</strong> to talk to a candidate with with a History BA and a Computer
Science MS.</p>

<p>For those of you who frequently read this blog (n ≈ 0) you'll
notice that it looks a bit different. I've moved it from my own
hosted Wordpress instance to static pages generated by <a href="http://www.getnikola.com/">Nikola</a>
and hosted up on <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Why bother?  I didn't like my blog being something I wouldn't be
proud to write or operate myself.  Wordpress was overkill and
not worth the trouble:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wordpress is database driven for dynamic sites. My little blog isn't
  dynamic at all. Once you buy into the static idea, lots of otehr
  things fall into place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comments and account spam are still is a nuisance. The nice
  people at <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> have done a great job holding back the tide, 
  but I still get at least one bogus registration a day. I expect a 
  service like Disqus or Facebook or Google+ will be more likely
  to keep pace with the spammers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to author in markdown; maybe even ReST someday. All this
  wysiwyg-ish stuff in browsers is for the birds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't actually need to host anything. I'm not running my own IRC
  server or anything. Even though <a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> has been a perfectly
  good service, I just want something... well, less Wordpress-ey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choosing</h3>
<p>So I need to pick a static web site hosting package, specifically
one that is good for blogs.  The big things I was looking for:
static site generation, Markdown/ReST support, and ability
to host on free services like Github Pages.</p>
<p>In additon I wanted these things (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>active development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in real use on real sites</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>easy customization, ideally by theming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ability to move over posts and comments, probably via Wordpress's
  export function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>python, what I program in for fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bit extensible</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I considered three options before settling on Nikola.  There are a
ton of static site generators, even when you limit them to Python.
But the only alternatives I seriously looked at were <a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> and
<a href="http://ringce.com/hyde">Hyde</a>.  Of these Nikola seems to have the most active development
and the richest set of features.  I ease especially drawn by their
good documentation and theming.</p>
<h3>Up and Running</h3>
<p>Here are my notes of what it took.  This isn't a nicely-written howto,
but if you want to see the blow-by-blow, read on.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The software was easy to set up and get started</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pip install nikola</code> did the right thing.  Of course
  within a virtual environment, you have to keep the lab clean!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along the way I found a few other requirements, like request,
  phpserialize, and markdown. These were easy to find/fix because of
  helpful error messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is all now captured in the project's <code>requirements.txt</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial import from wordpress XML dump went <em>ok</em> but a fair bit of
   manual HTML prettification took some time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The slugs aren't how I like them: <code>201311seven-things.wp</code> 
  instead of <code>seven-things.wp</code>.  I tried a bit to do mass
  rewrite of those, but couldn't easily do that without breaking
  everything, so just decided to let this go for now.  I'll just do
  slugs without dates going forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I considered <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/html2text/">html2text</a> but figured I'd just let the HTML 
  slide for now. Too much trouble to go back and clean all that
  up now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The "wp" extension, by default, is mapped to markdown instead of
  html.  Odd but easy to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikola has a nice simple redirect facility that the importer
  pre-populated for me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Migrate threads to <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> - clean and simple,
   worked right out of the box.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>wordpress plugin has a nice import facility.  Said it'd take a
  day, but didn't take that long at all.  Aside from one thread with 
  75 comments, not much else that should cause them much heartache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nice simple URL mapping utility</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publishing to github. Again, easy peasy. The way to make this work
   is to put all your static files in a repo titled
   <code>USERNAME.github.io</code>.  In my case: 
   <code><a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io">sefk.github.io</a></code>.  Just 
   a couple of "tricks" were needed to make this work smoothly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>So that it would correctly serve my own domain, you have to put a
     CNAME file in the root of the repo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I put my nikola themes and source files in the "src" subdirectory,
     and changed the <code>OUTPUT_DIR</code> configuration option to
     <code>..</code>.  Github Pages wants things in the root.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final swich.  I moved my domain from Dreamhost over to
   <a href="http://gandi.fr/">Gandi</a>, which is the registrar I like to use.  They throw in
   basic DNS with registration, which is sufficient for me.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>So There You Have It</h3>
<p>So far I am really pleased with the result. It's a bit more work to
publish, but for me that's natural and what I want. I guess I wouldn't
recommend this to someone who isn't adept with all these bits (virtual
environments, DNS, github repos, etc.) but for me that's no problem.</p>
