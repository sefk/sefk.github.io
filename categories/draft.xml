&lt;p&gt;If I could do my college years over, I'd take more writing courses.
Especially ones tht involve a lot of writing, that focus on the
skills and the craft of writing. I used to consider myself a decent
writer. But now that I'm working, I've learned that engineers spend
much more time writing than you expect. And I appreciate how hard
it is to write well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're saying: but wait, you're a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-Haired_Boss"&gt;pointy-haired boss&lt;/a&gt;
now, one of those guys who doesn't do Real Work anymore. You write
mails and boss people around. Well, there's some truth to that. But
I'd like to convince you that even monster coders, if they're any
good, write a lot, write well, and value good writing in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lunchtime conversation with &lt;a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/"&gt;Jacob Kaplan-Moss&lt;/a&gt;,
Django's co-founder, at last year's PyCon. When asked why his
project took off, he replied "because we wrote good docs." The
Django team didn't treat documentation as an afterthought. They
have lots of docs, and they are good.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Tech</category><category>Draft</category><guid>http://sef.kloninger.com/posts/learn-to-write.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jan 2014 20:43:15 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
