<p>Thick apps won mobile. Fine. </p>
<p>On laptop (and desktop) it's not so clear. What is better, thick or thin?
I tend to live mostly in thin land, although I use some thick apps
regularly, like Twitter's Mac client and Apple Photos.</p>
<p>Every so often I give a big native app a try: <strong>Excel</strong> instead of
<strong>Google Sheets</strong>, <strong>Mail.app</strong> instead of <strong>Gmail</strong>, <strong>Reminders</strong>
instead of the barebones <strong>Tasks</strong> built into Gmail. (I can't bring myself
to try Word). But it's disappointing to see how those fancy apps keep
shooting themselves in the foot!</p>
<p>Take for example this Excel error message. Excel is whining that it
can't verify my subscription the first time I ran Excel untethered
(version 15.11.2, for what its worth). Sure you can click through the
warning, but would a newbie know to do that? At best off-putting, at worst
downright disorienting. Why warn me of this at all? And why in a modal
that stops me dead in my tracks?</p>
<p>It seems thick apps should win. They rock the unplugged use case. An even
better situation is flaky networks -- tethered, conference WiFi,
travelling. UI's deal notoriously poorly with intermittent or partial
outages. A thick client, relying on that connection only for hitting
API's, can hide the network.</p>
<p>Another place they should shine is the UI itself. They should be fast,
beautiful, and featureful. Too often they're not. For example I find
Mail.app to be clunky, difficult to customize, and its keyboard shortcuts
few and poorly done. Gmail is pretty good!</p>
<p>Finally there's the upgrade problem. Thick apps need conscious effort from
their users before their work sees user time and they get feedback. And
that's what drives innovation. Long cycles means slower (less) invention.
One example I love is Gmail's "undo send" feature. Boy, you sure do miss
that when you need it and it's not there! That should be on every thick
client by now, but I don't think it is. I do know that Gmail has it and
Mail.app still doesn't.</p>
<p>Maybe the Internet can help. Look at <strong><a href="https://www.getchrome.com/">Chrome</a></strong> with its awesome auto
updates. What makes this work is solid engineering and exceptional quality
control. I've never seen behind the Google curtain, but I bet there's no
magic, just a lot of good engineering that leads to good software. Like:
good design and code reviews, tons of test coverage across many scenarios,
diverse and well-instrumented canaries, and thorough performance and
resource use testing. If Google didn't all of that so well, then we
wouldn't accept frequent pushes. Without the frequent upgrade cycle,
Chromes feature cycle would languish.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.getelectron.com/">Electron</a></strong> is another bright spot. This is the framework that gives
Slack and GitHub's thick clients their fit and finish. It makes these feel
like true native apps, even though they are mostly web controls with
JavaScript the covers. Right-clicking still doesn't do what I want, and
text controls are finicky, but it's close. But what those rough edges buy
you, and the software producer, are frequent, reliable, and clean
upgrades.</p>
<p>My natural preference would be for thick apps. If they were done well,
I'd use them.</p>

<p>I left <a href="http://www.wavefront.com/">my last job</a> a few weeks back and it's high time to look for a new
one. If you're working on something interesting and think I could help, <a href="mailto:sefklon@gmail.com">let
me know</a>! </p>
<p>It's nice to not have a day job while looking for another. I was lucky enough
to do this <a href="posts/201204my-sabbatical.html">once before in 2012</a> which turned out great. I learned then
that time and flexibility lets you talk to lots of friends and learn about a
breadth of projects. I found a fun project in a new domain (<a href="posts/201207on-line-education.html">online
education</a>), something I doubt I'd have found the normal way.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll get lucky again.</p>
<p>Enough small talk, what am I looking for?</p>
<p>I'm looking for some flavor of <strong>line manager</strong>. I'm a good senior manager and
code-every-day engineer; but I'm exceptional leading a team and running a
project. That's what line managers do: lead engineers, not other managers or
departments or matrix-anything. Also, if you're some kind of executive then
coding is an indulgence, and I'd rather it just be part of my job. Mostly I'm
talking to <strong>small companies</strong>, say 10-100 people (fun-size).</p>
<p>I want to <strong>build on my experience</strong>. I know infrastructure and cloud, SaaS
and enterprise, and online education. I'm probably not the best person for
your storage, security, gaming, e-commerce, or cryptocurrency company. I want
to stay working on <strong>Internet technology</strong>. I like the (micro)services model.
For my own projects I choose Python, JavaScript (frontend and backend), and
Java. I know web operations, especially the <a href="posts/aws.html">Amazon stack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong> is important: I don't want to do a daily Menlo Park to San
Francisco round-trip. I'd like to <strong>work with friends</strong> if possible. And I
want to do something <strong>worthwhile</strong>.</p>
<p>You can always get to my resume from the header here, or via this <a href="http://bit.ly/sef-resume">short
link</a>. I'm open to a bunch of things, just no <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgu7jdc_fs">kick boxing</a>.  Let's
have coffee/drink or take a walk.</p>

<p>I've spent the last three years building and operating web sites
with Amazon Web Services and here are a few lessons I've learned. 
But I first have to come clean that I'm a fan of AWS with only
casual experience with other IAAS/PAAS platforms.</p>
<p><strong>S3 Is Amazing</strong>. They made the right engineering choices and
compromises: cheap, practically infinitely scalable, fast enough,
with good availability. $0.03/GB/mo covers up for a lot of sins.
Knowing it's there changes how you build systems.</p>
<p><strong>IAM Machine Roles From The Start</strong>. IAM with <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html">Instance Metadata</a>
is a powerful way to manage secrets and rights. Trouble is you can't add
to existing machines. Provision with machine roles in big categories
(e.g. app servers, utility machines, databases) at the start, even if 
just placeholders.</p>
<p><strong>Availability Zoness Are Only Mostly Decoupled</strong>. After the 2011
<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202805/cloud-computing/amazon-ec2-outage-calls--availability-zones--into-question.html">us-east-1 outage</a> we were reassured that a coordinated 
outage wouldn't happen again, but it happened again just
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/2zpag7/aws_internal_dns_outage/">last month</a>.</p>
<p><strong>They Will Lock You In And You'll Like It</strong>. They secondary services
work well, are cheap, and are handy. I'm speaking of SQS, SES,
Glacier, even Elastic Transcoder. Who <em>wants</em> to run a durable queue
again?</p>
<p><strong>CloudFormation No</strong>. It's tough to get right. My
objection isn't programming in YAML, I don't mind writing Ansible plays, it's the
complexity/structure of CloudFormation that is impenetrable. Plus
even if you get it working once, you'd never run it again on something
that is running.</p>
<p><strong>Boto Yes</strong>. Powerful and expressive. Don't script the CLI, use
Boto. Easy as pie.</p>
<p><strong>Qualify Machines Before Use</strong>. Some VMs have lousy networking,
presumably due to a chatty same-host or same-rack neighbor. Test
for loss and latency to other hosts you own and on EBS. (I've used
home-grown scripts, don't know of a standard open-source widget,
someone should write one).</p>
<p><strong>VPC Yes</strong>. If you have machines talking to each other (i.e. not a
lone machine doing something lonely) then put them in a VPC. It's not
hard.</p>
<p><strong>NAT No</strong>. You think that'll improve security, but it will just
introduce SPOFS and capacity chokepoints. Give your machines publicly
routable IP's and use security groups.</p>
<p><strong>Network ACLs Are A Pain</strong>. Try to get as far as you can with just security
groups.</p>
<p><strong>You'll Peer VPC's Someday</strong>. Choose non-overlapping subnet IP ranges
at the start. It's hard to change later.</p>
<p><strong>Spot Instances Are Tricky</strong>. They're only For a very specific use
case that likely isn't yours. Setting up a test network? You can
spend the money you save by using spot on swear jar fees.</p>
<p><strong>Pick a Management Toolset</strong>. Ansible, Chef, all those things aren't
<em>all</em> that different when it comes down to it. Just don't dither back
and forth. There's a little bit of extra Chef love w/ AWS but not enough to tip
the scales in your decision I'd reckon. </p>
<p><strong>Tech Support Is Terrible</strong>. My <a href="http://www.wavefront.com/">last little
startup</a> didn't get much out of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">business level tech
support</a> we bought. We needed it so we could call in to get
help when we needed it, and we used that for escalating some problems.
It was nice to have a number to call when I urgently need to up a
system limit, say. But debugging something real, like a networking
problem? Pretty rough.</p>
<p><strong>...Unless You Are Big</strong>. Stanford, on the other hand, had a named
rep who was responsive and helpful. I guess she was sales, but I
used her freely on support issues and she worked the backchannels
for us. Presumably this is what any big/important customer would
get, that's just not you, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Power Is On Demand</strong>. I'm reaffirming cloud
koolaid here. Running this way lets you build and run systems
differently, <em>much better</em>. I've relied on the cloud this to bring
up emergency capacity. I've used it to convert a class of machines
on the fly to the double-price double-RAM tier when hitting a
surprising capacity crunch. There are a whole class of problems
that get much easier when you can have 2x the machines for just a
little while.  When someone comes to you with that cost/benefit
spreadsheet arguing why you should self-host, that's when you need
your file of "the cloud saved my bacon" stories at the ready.</p>

<p>When I have to tell someone no, I pick up the phone. I <strong>hate</strong>
talking on the phone, but I do it anyway.</p>
<p>When you're answering no to someone, you're disappointing them even
if just a little bit. So you owe it to them to talk instead of
sending an email. It's the polite thing to do.</p>
<p>But there are two other reasons, selfish reasons, for making the
call. First, you get immediate feedback on how they took the news.
If they're upset then you can do damage control straight away. And
at least you know! And second, delivering bad news directly and
respectfully is an important skill to develop. We can all use the
practice. And it's never as bad as I think it will be.</p>

<p>This year's Halloween tally was 208.  I don't know why we have 32%
fewer trick-or-treaters than we had last year, which was down 20%
from the year before that.  Maybe the rain earlier in the day kept
people home.  Maybe because it was Friday people opted for parties
instead of going door to door.  I don't know.</p>

<p>For the past five years I've gathered statistics on how many
trick-or-treaters have come by on Halloween.  If you want to read
about that, check out posts from <a href="posts/201311halloween-2013.html">last year</a> or <a href="posts/201210halloween-candy-data.html">the year before</a>.
This post is about <strong>how</strong> I track those stats, and how I don't.</p>
<p>Every year I'm tempted to build some fancy system to collect and
manage these statistics.  Wouldn't it be fun, say, to wire up some
Raspberry Pi sensor that automatically counts and tweets running
totals?  It wouldn't be <em>that</em> hard and sounds like fun.</p>
<p>The problem is making something like that reliable.  You'd have to
do all the un-fun stuff, like testing and contingency planning.  If
your baseline is a clipboard, paper, and a ball point pen, your bar
for failure is basically "never".  Even if I did build something
fancy I'd still end up doing backup tallies by hand.  At this human
scale, the tech ends up being a fun gimmick, not required.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a story from friend [Tony].  Tony
and his brother <a href="https://twitter.com/ProtomCannon">Tom</a> run a giant gaming convention every year,
the <a href="http://evo.shoryuken.com/">Evolution Championship Series</a> (Evo for short).  It's a
multi-day convention in Las Vegas that attracts something like ten
thousand participants.  They run the whole thing with their two
other founders and some friends — I'm sure they have some
paid help now, but the four guys are the main ones.  It's impressive.</p>

<p>Given that Tony and Tom are strong engineers, I figured this would
be a slick high-tech operation.  Not so.</p>
<p>Tony said they've tried tech at various points and it wasn't worth
it.  It's easy to see why that is tempting: they have multiple
mobile coordinators that need access to changing, shared information,
like brackets and schedules.  But what they've tried has let them
down.  Usually it's not the hard parts that fail, but the basics,
like batteries and wireless connectivity.  So they still run this
off of printouts and voice communications (cell phones/walkie-talkies)
and periodic data dumps.</p>
<p>And so, this year I'll be gathering my Halloween stats like I always
have: clipboard, pen, and a hand-held <a href="http://www.amazon.com/STEELMASTER-Counter-Inches-Silver-200100492/dp/B0089KJSFQ/ref=sr_1_3">tally counter</a>.  The data
will still be timely and accurate.</p>

<p>Two postscripts.  First, Please stop spreading that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQy1DH38E5g">NASA Space Pen story</a>.  I'm sure you've heard it: how do you write in zero G?
the wasteful Americans commissioned a multi-million dollar space
pen project; the scrappy can-do Russians used pencils.  Well, this
story has been <a href="http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp">debunked by the good people at Snopes</a>.</p>
<p>And second, I'd like to plug Tony and Tom's "day job", <a href="http://stonehearth.net/">Stonehearth</a>.
I think of it as Starcraft meets Minecraft.  I am so eager to play
it when it lands.</p>

<p>Friday was my last day building Stanford's <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/">open-source online education
platform</a>.  What started as a lark turned out to be one of the most
fun and rewarding times in my career.  So I'll use this opportunity to
reflect back on the project and what we accomplished.</p>
<h3>First a Little History</h3>
<ul><i>
    "MOOCs are just information technology happening to higher education."  
    -- George Siemens
</i></ul>
<p>I joined Stanford in 2012, coming off of my self-imposed <a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201204my-sabbatical.html">sabbatical</a>.
My goal then had been to get hands-on again, to sharpen the technical
tools.  I did a few online classes and hobby projects, but my friend Jane
suggested I could do some good and have more fun working in a group back
on the Stanford campus (I'm an alum, after all).  So I joined her and a
small group of engineers in a conference room in the fourth floor of
<a href="http://www-cs.stanford.edu/info/gates">Gates</a>.</p>
<p>Recall what was happening in <a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201207on-line-education.html">education in 2012</a>.  Stanford's
<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs271">first</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">three</a> <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/Home/Databases/Engineering/about">big</a> Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) had
just made big splashes.  Later that year the New York Times would famously
declare 2012 to be the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/education/edlife/massive-open-online-courses-are-multiplying-at-a-rapid-pace.html">Year of the MOOC</a>.  What could consumer-grade
web tech could do for higher education?  Or even <em>do to</em> higher ed?  The
low cost and ease of cloud computing removed many of the barriers to trying
new things out.  You approach experimentation completely differently when
things get 100x or 1000x cheaper.  Profs were literally getting out their
credit cards and buying Wordpress blogs or throw up virtual machines for
automated grading.  Wild stuff.</p>
<p>So this was the environment when I joined Stanford.  That first summer we
built <a href="https://class2go.stanford.edu/">Class2Go</a> to host free online courses.  We went from empty
buffers to a live Python/Django site for hundreds of thousands of enrolled
students in eleven weeks.  Man, that was a fun ride.</p>
<p>We built Class2Go for a few reasons.  First, we feel strongly that Stanford
needs to control its destiny.  There is no "file format" for online ed
content, so every course development online is a bet on a platform.  And
we didn't want to be beholden to one platform vendor (still don't).  In
2012 the technology that had powered the early MOOCs were becoming "platforms"
and moving off-campus.  While we were happy with the success of Udacity,
Coursera, and (a year later later) NovoEd, we were also a bit wary.  They were
going to have to repay their investors at some point.  The last thing we
wanted was for online education to look like textbook publishing or academic
journals.  We know what happened there.</p>
<p>Second, we wanted to have a broad impact.  We were lucky enough to have
an engineering team at Stanford, but it makes no sense for every school
to develop their own platforms.  This kind of project is tailor made for
open source development, and I've advocated strongly for that since the
beginning.  Not only would this mean many others could benefit form the
software, Stanford would benefit from many more developers and see many
more use cases (and we have).</p>
<p>And the third reason is the need to modify the platform.  There are many
reasons why you need to get hands dirty in the code.  It could be just
developing a point feature, like <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-ora2/pull/620">tracking changes in peer evaluation</a>.
Or it could enable a whole new use case, like <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/67">authenticating
on-campus students</a>.  Our teachers and researchers want to do
interesting work online, not just put up courses.  They have great ideas
about using the things that make MOOCs unique (different cultures, scale,
data-gathering, etc.) as powerful tools, not obstacles to overcome.  (To
hear more about interesting online ed projects, follow the Stanford VPOL 
<a href="http://signalblog.stanford.edu/">Signal Blog</a>).</p>
<h3>Scaling Up With EdX</h3>
<p>Come early 2013 we started seeing some interest from others to use Class2Go
outside Stanford.  While exciting, we were concerned about the quality of
the code.  There were giant missing features that were going to be hard
to write (e.g. peer evaluation).  And the code was quick and dirty,
with nearly zero tests and other things a "real project" needs.  We could
have backfilled all of that, but it sounded like a lot of work.</p>
<p>It's around that time that we started talking with edX.  Our academic ties
to MIT, Harvard, and other edX consortium members are strong.  We liked
their philosophy and approach.  And our technologies were similar: both
Python/Django stacks running in Amazon, etc.  We decided to work together.
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robvrubin">Rob Rubin</a> and I got the deal done quickly, mostly between sessions
at PyCon.  In April 2013 we <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/april/edx-collaborate-platform-030313.html">announced</a> that we'd shutter Class2Go
and adopt the Open edX platform.</p>
<p>Stanford didn't join the XConsortium.  Rooted in our belief in the power
of open source, we made open-sourcing their platform a condition of us
working together.  EdX didn't need convincing.  But Stanford was of
a forcing function to do it then, and it did take some work.  They <a href="http://ostatic.com/blog/edx-open-sources-its-super-influential-online-learning-platform">pushed
the button</a> on June 1 2013.</p>
<p>For the past year and a half the Stanford team has operated as a virtual
member of the extended edX engineering team.  They've been a fun group to
work with, generous with their time and good collaborators.  We've been
running the platform successfully now for over a year, supporting dozens
of courses for Stanford students, MOOCs, online high school students, and
many other uses.  We've contributed back many features, like theming,
course email, instructor analytics to name a few.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of my own time helping to make sure the Open edX project
a healthy open source project.  It's not enough to just open up the code,
to have a thriving community you have to conduct your development out in
the open.  Beyond helping other institutions get up and running I've worked
to drive the open-source agenda overall.  With my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/natea">Nate Aune</a>
last May we <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/edx-code/DRqcLlMKhgs/KBvzBj13hQ8J">published recommended changes</a> to technology, governance,
and community.  And with <a href="https://twitter.com/podehaye">Paul-Olivier Dehaye</a> this past June we
hosted the first <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/edx-code/EqVUkvovq0k/e2Be2fo5QJUJ">Open edX workshop</a>, in Zürich.  I think those efforts
have made a difference.</p>
<h3>Moving On</h3>
<p>I've heard the siren's song of the startup.  Last Friday August 29th was
my last day at Stanford.  I'll post about my <a href="http://www.wavefront.com/">next gig</a> when the time
is right.</p>
<p>But I do feel good about moving on.  The Stanford engineering team is solid
and productive.  The engineers work well with each other and have a good
breadth of skills.  The course operations team is dedicated and strong.
<a href="https://twitter.com/jinpa1345">Jane Manning</a> will do great running the team in addition to her day
job as of product management -- she's done this before and knows the product
inside and out.  And <a href="https://github.com/jbau">Jason Bau</a>, the Stanford Open edX tech lead,
will continue to anchor eng and ops.</p>
<p>And what about the open source community?  I do feel like the flywheel is
starting to spin up.  EdX is fostering this in several ways, I'll mention
two.  First, they are in the process of opening up their bug tracking
database and sprint planning (Jira).  That's a key step to doing true <em>open
development</em>.  And second, I'm really excited to see the first full-on
<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/edx-code/bqASLi8FZjs/Eb6OQpHbevsJ">Open edX conference</a> happening this upcoming November.  I expect
that to be well attended.</p>
<p>EdX has asked me to continue on as a member of the Technical Advisory
Board, which I am happy and honored to do.  I look forward to staying
plugged into the project and working with my friends on the board (Armando,
Ike, Jim, Phil, Ross...)</p>
<p>Thanks to my many friends on the project: the Open edX engineering team,
especially Jason and Jane; the team in the Office of the Vice Provost for
Online Learning, especially Professor <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/">John Mitchell</a> who made this
possible; and my many friends at edX.  There's a lot to be proud of over
the past two years, and a lot of good work ahead.</p>
