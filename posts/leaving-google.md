An offer of a Voluntary Exit from Google HR landed in my mailbox right around my
ten-year anniversary with the company, give or take. We'd had a couple of
packages like this at Google ([news][]) before, basically a similar deal to
getting laid off. But this was the first one put in front of those of us working
in one of the big revenue engines of the company &mdash; I worked on Search.

I wasn't aiming to leave. I liked the work, I had a good team and [boss][]. But
the package was enough to kickstart a discussion, "why _not_ now?". My wife and
I ran numbers and discussed our futures. I clicked the button. My last day as a
Googler was earlier this week, October 4th.

I have good feelings about my time at Google. Part of what was fun was variety:
three years at YouTube, three years at Cloud, and four years at Search. I got to
play with big infrastructure and solve some hard problems. I saw behind the
curtain. But mostly I value the smart and interesting people I got to work with.
Kind of a cliche, but it's the truth.

Not everything was great. I've decided that I won't use this space for dishy
writing about how Google isn't all it claims to be. But I sure do love war
stories and grousing. If you want to take me out for a beer, I'm around.

What's next? I haven't decided if this is retirement, or a sabbatical, or
something else. I've been off work for extended stretches twice before, once by
choice and once not. Those two times taught me that the difference between a
wonderful, mind-expanding time and a stress-fest is my own mindset. My mindset
going into this time is good.

I'm excited about the time ahead; I'm fortunate to have the time to focus on
what's important.
