Google's offer of a Voluntary Exit Package landed in my mailbox right about the
time I was reaching my ten-year anniversary. Similar things had been offered to
some of the narrow-margin areas of the business, (news][]), but this was one of
the first times to touch the traditional revenue engines, like the PA I was in,
K&I, and a few others, like Core. \[[1](#note1)\].

I wasn't looking to leave. I was doing good work with a good team, and I had a
[boss][]. The package was enough to start a discussions with my wife, "hey, why
_not_ now". My last day was August 14th and October 4th was when I formally fell
off the books.

I have good feelings about my time at Google. I worked three years at YouTube,
three years at Cloud, and three years at Search. During that time I got to work
alongside some exceptional people.

I've decided not to write a bunch of dishy stories about things I didn't like
so much at Google. But if you want to take me out for a beer, I'm around.

What's next? I haven't decided if this is a retirement, or sabbatical, or what.
I've been off work twice before, once by choice and once not. The first one was
wonderful and and expanded my view of what was possible; the second was
stressful. The main difference was me: was I able to have an open-minded and
exploratory mindset, or one of worry and obligation. I can confidently say that
I'm going into this time off with a very positive and good mindset.

One thing I look forward to doing is writing a lot in this space, mostly just
for me. I enjoy writing. It's a nice way to reflect back on my thirty years in
software engineering.

One thing I'm concerned about is missing the built-in community of bright,
like-minded people that I got to work alongside all those years. I'm not sure
quite yet what that is, but I'm sure I'll find it. I always have.

#### Notes
<a name="note1"></a>

1. Google is organized into roughly a dozen Product Areas (PA's). Mostly they
   correspond to things that you'd recognize from the outside, like YouTube and
   Cloud. There's one biggie, Knowledge & Information, that covers Search, Ads,
   and related things like Maps.
