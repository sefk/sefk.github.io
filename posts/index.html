    <p><em>What's the value of an experiment or a prototype?</em></p>
<p>There are all kinds of ways to have impact. A feature can improve user
experience; a hardening project can reduce risk of a production outage;
refactoring or test coverage can improve velocity or make software easier and
safer to maintain. And good engineers care a lot about impact. While it's not
the only thing that matters (the "how" is important too), if you start with
impact, you'll generally do well.</p>
<p>An engineer's job to put ideas into practice, to make things. But sometimes
we're not sure what to make. Or we think we know, but aren't sure it'll work.
The best way to figure that out is often running a set of experiments, or maybe
building a prototype (an n=1 experiment).</p>
<p>But crucially, an experiment doesn't have value itself. An experiment is
successful only if we've learned something. The intent of the test rig or
prototype isn't to live on. Indeed, knowing that we plan to throw it away is
part of what makes it fast and cheap to build, and it shouldn't have all the
trappings of production-quality software, like test coverage and code reviews.</p>
<p>So how do we ensure that value gets delivered? When you work in a team or a
company people turn over. It's not just enough to do the experiment, you need to
write it up and share your results. To produce a good writeup, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Figure out your hypothesis(es)</strong> that you're testing. Often this is in the
   form of one or more questions. For prototypes, it might be a boolean, i.e. we
   can build X that will work. But even then, consider what "done" means. What
   are you measuring? (*)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State your assumptions and method</strong>. This is where you usually get the most
    feedback. Note that this usually isn't a project plan, as your reviewers
    usually don't care how long it takes or what happens when. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek feedback</strong> from your peers. Publish the doc stating the method to have
    smart people poke holes in your plan and make sure what you're measuring
    will actually address the hypothesis. And then when the experiment is done,
    get it reviewed by someone senior to ensure that your work supports your
    conclusion. This also spreads knowledge about this work (both that you're
    doing it, and the results) so the overall organization benefits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The artifact produced has many benefits. It's useful for you as you discuss
follow-on work; it's useful come performance evaluation time. But most
importantly, it benefits the organization. Contemporary and future peers can
learn from this work. </p>
<p>You'll benefit from taking the time to write it up, the reviewers learn from
reading, and it'll live on past your time with the team.</p>

<p>Sponsorship is using your position and influence to help someone get ahead. It's
similar in many ways to mentorship, the topic of my <a href="mentoring">last post</a>.
But sponsorship is a bit tricker. Most people understand mentorship
and have good feelings about it. Sponsorship is a bit less familiar and might
even feel a bit unseemly â€” at least it used to feel that way to me.</p>
<p>Although I'd heard the concept before, a talk <a href="https://www.carlaspearls.com/">Carla Harris</a> gave at Google in
2022 made an impression on me and brought it to the forefront. (She has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE_W50OTUc">2019
TED Talk</a> that hits a lot of the same points). She spoke about the value of
sponsorship, both on the receiving end early in her career and now as a sponsor
herself. More than just her description, what I most appreciated was her candor.
It gave me a permission structure to use this concept myself. I started using it
with junior engineers when thinking about their careers; I thought about it
myself when debugging how some decision played out. It also helped me to think
of it less judgmentally. Now I see it as being thoughtful and pragmatic about
how decisions are made.</p>
<p>So what it it? Sponsoring is similar to mentoring in that it's an investment in
someone, but the mechanism is different. Mentoring is a commitment to
problem-solve issues as they come up, teach skills, and serve as a sounding
board, amongst other things. Sponsoring is more strategic. The sponsor is
committing to understand the sponsored's goals and strengths, and (here's the
important part) help them get ahead. The time commitment isn't as large, but the
<em>actual commitment</em> is greater. Assuming they see eye-to-eye, the sponsor
commits to <em>putting their reputation on the line</em> to help the their person
achieve their goals. Some examples would be vouching for the sponsored during a
staffing conversations or seeking out and advocating for them when opportunities
comes up.</p>
<p>In some ways, sponsorship acknowledges and even co-opts the "you have to know
somebody" way that the world actually works. Underrepresented groups can benefit
from sponsorship as a way to wedge into existing power structures. If that
describes you, consider asking for someone to explicitly sponsor you; if you're
in a traditionally privileged group, consider sponsoring someone who isn't so
much.  My Google peer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-grey-b69319/">Rachel</a> observed: "women are often over-mentored and
under-sponsored."</p>
<h4>Maybe You're Going Up For Promotion</h4>
<p>With this in mind, let's apply this to promotions.</p>
<p>Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias these decisions, they are complicated
and are made by real-world humans. Organizations rely on their senior people to
bring their experience, knowledge, and judgment to bear.</p>
<p>Consider how the promotion decision will be made for your case. One key question
is <strong>who'll be in the room</strong>? This isn't just who is invited and who will
attend, but more who will be <strong>influential</strong> in the discussion and decision
making process, and <strong>for what</strong> kinds of questions. Not everyone has an equal
voice.</p>
<p>Say you're an engineer going up for promotion to senior engineer. Then likely a
senior tech lead (not necessarily <em>your</em> tech lead!) will be asked to speak to
the quality of your work (e.g. good code, considered alternatives,
future-proofing). A senior manager will likely be asked to assess how well you
worked with others and made good decisions. And these are just two of the
factors â€” there will be many others depending on your role and level. You
need to work down the rubric and think through who'll be asked to attest to each
area as it comes up. Who will be asked to speak to concerns when they're raised
("was that <em>really</em> that hard?")?</p>
<p>Sometimes you might know who the key person will be, but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.</p>
<p>And then assess their level of support. This may be something you can do
yourself (if you have a relationship already) or maybe you'll need your
manager's help. But somehow you need to ask them, as candidly as you can, "If
asked about X, what will you say?" It can sometimes be hard to get an honest
answer, so you may need to push a little. Reassure them you'd much rather know
now if you have their support or not and you're not going to hold it against
them.</p>
<p>If you don't have their support yet, that's OK. Think about work you can do
to change that over time.</p>
<h4>Day-To-Day Decisions</h4>
<p>Not all decisions are as high-stakes as promotions. Leaders make decisions all
the time, like whom to trust to lead a project or run a meeting. I like to think
about these small-but-important decisions too in the context of sponsorship. Is
your manager your sponsor? What about your TL?</p>

<p>So you're looking for a mentor, that's great! I've benefitted a lot
from mentors in my career. It'll be a valuable experience for
both you and your mentor. This post has my tips for finding a good
mentor, asking them, and maintaining a good ongoing relationship.</p>
<h4>Choosing</h4>
<p>These are my three go-to rules for finding a mentor. They've held
up across many companies and years.</p>
<p>1. Your mentor should be <strong>someone you admire</strong>. The best choice
is usually someone the same career path as you, but further along
by some years. They don't have to be so much more senior, it could
just be the next step, but they've shown that they're willing and
able to take on more responsibility and how to do it at your company.
Ideally they're someone interesting, inspirational, and relateable.</p>
<p>Another type of mentoring relationship is when you're looking to
make a change â€” say from Engineer to Engineering Manager, or
Engineering Manager to Product Manager. Then you're looking for
someone who made the switch. I find they're often the most eager
to talk about how and why they did it.</p>
<p>2. Organizationally close-by is OK, but they <strong>shouldn't be one
of your leaders</strong>. I've gotten the most out of mentors outside my
chain of command. That way, I never had to worry about choosing my
words (or topics) carefully. I could problem solve or just vent.
Sometimes the person you need to discuss is your own
<a href="problem-or-solution-boss">boss</a>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Rapport is super important</strong>. Maybe the most important thing
of all. Your meetings can't feel like a chore for either of you.
Even if you've gotten along fine in the past, maybe you'll hit it
off in this new relationship, maybe now.</p>
<p>How can you find the right person if it's not obvious who to ask? Use
your network, talk to people, ask for referrals. Big companies often
have mentoring programs for matchmaking.</p>
<h4>Asking</h4>
<p>While your mentor will benefit a bit, you'll be the one getting the
most out of this deal. So it's up to you to ask. Understand that
they're likely busy, so say how much you'd appreciate some of their
time. Make sure they know it's OK to say no.</p>
<p>I recommend asking for a trial run to start with: "Let's do three
or four meetings and then re-evaluate." That way you can make sure
that it's clicking, see the "rapport" criteria above. If it's not
feeling great <em>on both sides</em> then it's best to try again with
someone else, no harm no foul.</p>
<h4>Being A Good Mentee</h4>
<p>So you've found someone, great. Here's some things you should do
during probation and onward.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Respect their time</strong>. Be prompt. Work around their schedule
and in a way that works best for them (30 min? over a meal?).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Come prepared with a topic or two</strong>, keep a backlog. It can
be something specific, like problem solving a particular situation
or relationship. Or it could be getting just-in-time feedback on a
draft email or document. Or it could be open-ended, e.g. "if you
could advise your former self 10 years ago, what would you have
said?"</p>
<p>3. <strong>Check in</strong> from time to time. Make sure this is still working
out for them: the style of meeting, duration, etc.</p>
<p>4. Find an appropriate way to <strong>thank them</strong>. Nothing big but it's
important to show that you appreciate their time. For example at
my current employer (Google) we have a system to give shout-outs
to peers that come up at performance review time.</p>
<p>Finally, find a way to <strong>pay it forward</strong>. Introduce mentors and
mentees; volunteer in your company's matchmaking service; find
people who appear to stranded and offer to help them out. Sending
this post might be a fine icebreaker.</p>

<p>I was so disappointed in Oppenheimer. It wasn't terrible, but what
a missed opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Mystifying</strong>. Part of the job of a biopic is to give you insight
into what a person is thinking and feeling. Especially for this
movie, which is basically about this question: what would it be
like to be the person who made these terrible weapons?  I understand
he's complicated, and <em>it's</em> complicated.  But instead of dialog,
or even some outright explaining, this movie leans on of Cillian
Murphy staring into the distance or adjusting his hat.</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong>. There were plenty of interesting women they could have
brought in, either contemporaries, or from academia, or the
Manhattan project itself. There are only two women in the movie:
one is a sex object with mental health issues (Pugh); the other is
a mother/lush with a surprisingly sharp wit, but only for a minute
(Blunt). The sex scene, oddly using Oppenheimer's most famous line,
was gratuitous and super weird.</p>
<p><strong>Strauss</strong>. I'm not invested at all in the conflict with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Strauss">Admiral
Strauss</a>. Paraphrasing the good folks at <a href="https://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/703/">The Incomparable</a>, "I
don't care if some guy becomes Commerce Secretary in the Eisenhower
Cabinet."</p>
<p>Given how much I like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1451677618">history and the science</a> of this
period, I was really pulling for this movie. Dang.</p>

<p>I did a data cleanup over the weekend. I doubt this is interesting
for anyone else, I just wanted to capture my own notes.</p>
<p>Our family photos are stored up in Google Photos. We have about
100k photos and short movies that take up 0.5TB. I wanted to back
up to <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?product_line=ds_plus">local storage</a>, but also I liked the idea of trying the
<a href="https://www.mdisc.com/">mdisc</a> format for long-term storage.</p>
<p>I ran <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Takeout</a> and unzipped everything. I was surprised to see
so many duplicates. Some are copies in the same folders with suffixes
like "(1)", most are multiple copies in different folders.
Takeout seems to just store a copy for each album a photo is in.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10pRVc1_6u0G2z62uEJSHHZ0yzf43Zoa9yx0D2bpICmE/edit?usp=sharing">Some poking at the data</a> shows 88% of 302,755 files / 72% of
the bytes were unique (histogram at the bottom of the post).  Removing
dups can save 200+GB. Sure not really worth the trouble but why
not.</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>1. On the NAS, gather file checksums (<code>md5sum</code>) and sizes for all
the files under <code>Takeout/Google Files</code>. Mostly variations on
of <code>find -print0 | xargs -0</code>.</p>
<p>2. Data cleanup to get into nice file paths and clean delimiters,
mostly interactively with <code>vi</code>.</p>
<p>3. Insert into <code>sqlite</code> using <code>.separator</code> and <code>.import</code>.</p>
<p>Here's what the database ended up looking like: <code>Photos</code> and <code>Sizes</code>
are inputs, <code>HashCounts</code>, <code>Duplicates</code>, and <code>Candidates</code> are
outputs.</p>

<p>I was surprised that sqlplus supports window functions, nice.</p>
<p>The inner reverse-alpha sort on "path" takes care of two cases.
I tend to prefer keeping photos with names that start with
years, and Those come first alphabetically (nice). Also within
folders often there are many copies with "(1)" and "(2)" suffixes
that are generally cruft and most worthy of removing, and those
also sort last alphabetically (nice).</p>
<p>5. Dump out the "Candidates" using <code>.output</code>. Copy back to the NAS.
Do lots of spot checks. Convert to a bash script of <code>rm</code> commands,
run very carefully.</p>

<p><strong>Sqlite</strong> is my go-to tool for ad-hoc work like this.  It's fast
and simple, but only for small jobs -- this one is MB-scale.</p>

<p>My <strong>Synology</strong> is a pretty good place for storage with ability to
ssh in and run local commands.  But if I had to do this again,
though, I should have just bought a large locally-connected SSD.
All the transfers to-from the NAS were a hassle. Looking now I'm
stunned that you can get a 4 TB external SSD for under $300.</p>

<p>I listen to a fair number of podcasts. The <a href="https://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech
Podcast</a> is my favorite by a mile.</p>
<p>It's the one that I look forward to every week. It comes out on
Thursdays, often right when I'm leaving work. It's a sign that
the weekend is right around the corner.</p>
<p>I'll get some of the reasons why out of the way quickly, the reasons
particular to me and my tastes.</p>
<ul>
<li>The topic, the world of technology and all things around it,
  is right in my wheelhouse. It's my profession, but also my hobby.
  That's what got me in the door. If this stuff isn't your thing,
  then this podcast won't be either.</li>
<li>They talk a lot about Apple products and that ecosystem, which
  where I spend my personal time.</li>
<li>But they also cover a lot of issues that touch on the world of
  technology: business, law &amp; politics, companies, social media.
  I like their descriptions, their take, their rants.</li>
<li>They end up talking a lot about personal tech too. Like how to
  manage family photos and backups. The hard, fussy stuff that ends
  up taking up so much of our lives. For example, what's the best
  way to help parents deal with passwords. Hard stuff!</li>
<li>I especially like tech-adjacent topics like home audio/video,
  home automation, and gaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>But what I appreciate more than the content of ATP are the
hosts and the care they take to produce a good show.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are <strong>friends</strong>. It's nice hanging out with people
  who like each other. It's kind of like we have permission
  to eavesdrop and be a part of that.</li>
<li>They're not afraid to discuss <strong>their lives</strong>.
  Stuff like families and work/life stress.
  This is good stuff for me because I'm in the same life
  situation as them: middle-aged tech dads.
  But bringing their whole selves
  to the show is a bit of vulnerability that I appreciate.</li>
<li>ATP is <strong>exceptionally well produced</strong>. I didn't
  appreciate this until I'd heard so many other podcasts that
  are produced terribly, with bad recordings or poorly mixed.
  Usually you have to turn to the corporate, fancy
  podcasts, but they also have lots of ads and are
  usually different kinds of shows.</li>
<li>And the show is so <strong>well edited</strong>. They edit it without
  losing any of the content or the pacing, and sparing us all the
  awkward "um where were we" and technical futzing.</li>
<li>They <strong>don't talk over each other</strong>. Part of this is discipline,
  part of this is just politeness. But also now that I've listened
  to the pre-edit "bootleg" a couple of times, I've come to appreciate
  how much of this is also fixed in the edit.  Nice job Marco.</li>
<li>They are <strong>respectful</strong>.  They don't put people down, they aren't
  mean.  When they kid each other it's in good fun.</li>
<li>When (rarely) they wade into social justice or
  world events, they do so respectfully and thoughtfully.
  They understand that as three three cisgender white guys,
  it's good to have views to share, but also right to listen
  and help others.</li>
<li>Their show is <strong>reliable</strong>. It's great that they keep to a
  regular format and schedule. It fits into the rest of your life
  and becomes something you count on.</li>
<li>Finally, some small things: Yay for proper use of
  <strong>chapter markers</strong>, hardly anybody else uses them properly.
  And I like their
  their occasional forays into <strong>car talk</strong>, just because I like car
  stuff too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although they joke about how much of the show is devoted to feedback,
it's one of my favorite parts. It shows that they listen and are
learning.  And they share that learning with all of us. A recent
example was six minutes or so into <a href="https://atp.fm/570">Episode 570</a> when I learned
how home power battery systems, when full, signal this by changing
<em>the frequency of AC power</em> as a signal to solar panels to back off.
Fascinating!</p>
<p>I like the members-only specials. It's OK with me that these are
only available to members. They've been candid lately about ad
revenue drying up and they could use the extra revenue channel.
These episodes are a nice way to reward members. They've managed
to do these without compromising the core show.</p>
<p>The best thing they ever did on ATP was getting a sponsor to send John
toasters to review. And <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/9/10/siracusa-on-toasters">review he did</a>! I didn't appreciate how
many bad toasters there are, and how they can be bad for so many
reasons. My favorite reason was poor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/knobfeel">knob feel</a>.</p>
<p>Nice work <a href="https://hypercritical.co/">John</a>, <a href="https://marco.org/">Marco</a>, and <a href="https://caseyliss.com/">Casey</a>.
Please keep it up for a long, long time.</p>

<p>If you've traveled internationally, likely you've used a SIM card
for local data and calls. There is a nice ecosystem around SIMs
with a wealth of easy and affordable Pay As You Go (PAYG) options.</p>
<p>But the newer iPhones did away with the SIM slot if favor of some new
eSIM hotness. Apple has all kinds of <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209096">info</a> claiming they have good
international support, but I found reality falls short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only a few carriers support eSIM's,</li>
<li>The few that do require a contract. A tourist or student
   studying abroad is better served by a PAYG plan, and</li>
<li>Even if you can stomach a contract, that would require a UK bank
   account; no way to easily pull that off.</li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up falling back to <a href="https://www.att.com/international/day-pass/">international roaming</a>. It works but
is expensive.</p>
<p>I think Apple made the wrong call removing the trusty old SIM tray.
Clearly the new models can be made to work well with it, since how
they are sold in the UK.  If you're unlucky enough to have bought
your recent iPhone in the US, you're out of luck. </p>
<p>I this is an example of Apple bad tendency sometimes choose form
over function, "<a href="https://www.theringer.com/2016/9/7/16038622/why-did-apple-remove-the-headphone-jack-courage">courage</a>" over usability.</p>

    </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
    <p><a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"><img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="../f/bigdig.png" alt="Big Dig podcast title art (WGBH)" width="50%"></a></p>
<p>I just finished the <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig">Big Dig podcast</a> and it's worth
a listen. It's about Boston's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig">Central Artery/Tunnel Project</a>,
the most expensive highway project in US history. They cover the
whole story, from conception, to getting it approved, to years of
execution, and then the fallout from cost overruns and mismanagement.
The podcast is well produced and has a lot of primary-source
interviews.</p>
<p>I have a little bit of a personal connection, since I lived in
Boston during the project's later years when it was on the news <em>all the
time</em>. I even toured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_P._Zakim_Bunker_Hill_Memorial_Bridge">a part</a> under construction. </p>
<p>But what I find most compelling is trying to connect to the question,
can America build big infrastructure anymore? It's something I think
lot about. We benefit from by the giant projects from the past
(dams, bridges, interstates) but can't maintain them properly; we
struggle to take on new things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail">high-speed rail</a>.</p>
<p>They place most of the blame on headwinds that didn't exist in the
public-works heyday of the twentieth century. Leaders are under
more scrutiny; projects fall under a bunch of regulations intended
to protect the environment and workers. Public commentary slows
things down.</p>
<p>The problem is, while the old way was easier, it also caused a lot
of harm. I learned the story of the Cambridge and East Boston
families that stopped interstate projects that would have leveled
their homes and neighborhoods. I know those places well. I used to
own a home right where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_695_(Massachusetts)">one of those roads was supposed to have
been</a>. I sure am grateful to those protesters who won!</p>
<p>It ends on a hopeful note. Not that it's easy, nor are we necessarily
that much better managing big projects now. But there are success
stories.</p>
<p>One part I especially liked was <a href="https://overcast.fm/+BDdBHAXcVU/20:47">20 minutes into the final episode</a>,
in the final interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_P._Salvucci">Fred Salvucci</a>, where he told the
story Saint Francis. God tells Francis to build a cathedral, but
then tears it down. Francis builds another, God destroys it again.
Why, Francis asks. Because it's not enough to build a physical
cathedral, but you also have to build the support for it in the
hearts and minds of the people. Maybe that's the part we're not
doing well enough now.</p>
