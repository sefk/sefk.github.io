<p>Governments should produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good">public goods</a>, like navigation aids and roads. That
seems like a reasonable thing to expect of a functioning government, right?</p>
<p>I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
thorough measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.</p>
<p>Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to <strong>actually remove data</strong>. All through 2025,
websites were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals">Wikipedia page</a>
catalogs what's been happening, and this report by the <a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century">American Statistical
Association</a> goes into more depth about what's been happening and its
implications.</p>
<p>In response the <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/">Data Rescue Project</a> sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/">project's press page</a> has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact. Last
November I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers
and was eager to help.</p>
<h4>Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)</h4>
<p>It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on:
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.</p>
<p>HIFLD is a collection of maps. Maps of basic stuff, like roads, levees, river
depth charts, locations of military bases. Beyond just being good maps, a big
part of HIFLD's value is helping to make sure everyone uses <em>the same maps</em>.</p>
<p>So HIFLD is mostly curating data. Most of the data comes from other agencies
(USGS, Army Corps of Engineers, Census Bureau) and HIFLD brings it together and
provides it in a trustworthy, central place. Well, I should say "provided"
because in September the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/">government stopped providing it</a>. The story is well
told in this good <a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data">article on Project Geospatial</a>.</p>
<p>This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers immediately
scooped up the data and kept in temporary storage. Then they organized a bucket
brigade of volunteers to categorize and put <a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open">snapshots</a> into long-term storage.
Importantly, this was coupled with metadata to ensure they're findable later.
That's the part I worked on, uploading and entering metadata. We met our goal of
getting all of HIFLD "rescued" by year's end. <a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524">Frank Donnelly</a>, the project
manager, wrote up a nice <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/">summary</a> of what we did and how. For my piece I relied
on a nice Selenium driver, written by another volunteer, to create over a
hundred projects (<a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs">screen recording</a>).</p>
<p>This is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their <a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/">tracker</a> to see the
breadth of work.</p>
<p>While I'm proud of this project, I keep reminding myself that we're playing
defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having the
government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding better
leadership and a return to effective government. Assert your rights and
<a href="https://www.nokings.org/">protest</a>!   ❌ 👑.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to have met and shared a meal with Rob Reiner some years back. I
wanted to take a moment to share this story on the sad occasion of his death
this week.</p>
<p>It was 2003 or so. I lived and worked for Akamai in Boston. I had been going
back and forth to San Mateo office a fair bit that year, often taking a red eye
home from San Jose. Back then the San Jose airport was smaller than it is now,
and was especially quiet at the evenings. Not a lot of dinner options, so
McDonald's it was.</p>
<p>That day I was surprised to recognize Rob Reiner in line right in front of me!
He was traveling with some assistant-type person, patiently waiting. I tend to
not bother celebrities in public, but I was moved to say something.</p>
<p><strong>Sef</strong>: Hello Mr. Reiner. Forgive me but I just wanted to say how much I enjoy
your work. I'm a really big fan.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong> (big grin): Hi! What's your name? Thanks for introducing
yourself. What have I done that you like?</p>
<p>I think he genuinely wanted to know. I knew his big films pretty well —
<em>When Harry Met Sally</em> was the most popular, <em>A Few Good Men</em> had been up for
Best Picture, <em>Spinal Tap</em> is well, Spinal Tap. These are all really great
films.</p>
<p><strong>Sef</strong>: <em>The Princess Bride</em>, hands down. I love the story and I love what you
did with it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: I'm glad you said that. That's my favorite too.</p>
<p>Hearing that was more than I'd hoped for. I thanked him and begged off so he
could order his burger and have dinner in peace. But no, in that New Yorker
voice and with a big smile he said, "C'mon, let's have cheeseburgers!" The three
of us all sat.</p>
<p>We had a nice talk over dinner. He asked questions and seemed genuinely
interested in what I did -- work, family. But the highlight was toward the end.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: What else can I answer for you?</p>
<p><strong>Sef</strong>: What would you tell someone early in their career?</p>
<p>At this point I was about thirty years old, so hardly <em>that</em> early in my own
career, but I was asking in a genuine way. He answered straight away.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Reiner</strong>: <mark>Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every
day.</mark> Me, I like writing so I try to do that of it every day if I can.
That's how you get good.</p>
<p>He then told a few stories about people he'd met who don't do this. I guess when
you're someone like him, people ask you frequently for jobs or if you'd produce
their movie or whatnot. He said he asks what was the last thing they'd written,
or what they were working on now, or what'd they'd written today. And he could
tell if they did it often and did it for fun. If they didn't do it often, then
how good a writer were they likely to be?</p>
<p>I was struck by what a nice and interesting, and interested, person Rob Reiner
was. It was incredibly generous for him to spend time with a fanboy when he
could be off duty and just enjoying his cheeseburger. What a gem.</p>

<p>I turned off comments on this site today. The good people at <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> had
provided me with a free service for commenting that had worked for ten-plus
years. But they appear to have gone down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> path and
started running a bunch of link-spam right above the comment box on all my
pages. Of course they did. I captured a <a href="../f/disqus-enshittified.png">screenshot</a> if you want to see. Boo.</p>
<p>Shame on me for entrusting a company to handle content for my personal site in
the first place. Isn't controlling things the whole point of this old-school
blog business? Not a big loss, nobody had posted a comment in a long time. But
still.</p>

    <p>I've been <a href="leaving-google">off work</a> for about three months now. It's a
good occasion to take stock of how that's going. In a word, it's been <strong>great</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm surprised how much lighter my mood is. It feels like a weight that I've
  been carrying around for some time is no longer there. It's different than
  being on vacation, better actually. I didn't appreciate how stressful
  tech management has been all these years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm taking a ton of pleasure in simple things. I go grocery shopping almost
  every day, I'm doing a ton of cooking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It feels good to get healthier. I had knee surgery and am recovering from that
  just fine. I exercise nearly every day. On days that I don't go to <a href="https://www.bayclubs.com/clubs/redwoodshores">the
  gym</a> I do thirty minutes on the bike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's great to have flexibility. I hadn't planned to see my Dad on his 80th
  birthday because we'd on a bigger group thing later. But on a whim I drove
  down and took him out for breakfast on his actual birthday, because why not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I didn't want to do it before, I still don't want to do it. The closet
  hasn't gotten cleaned out; neither has the garage.</p>

<p>My friend Rachel Grey has a three month head start leaving Google. Her
writing this resonates with me. Especially this from recent LinkedIn post
(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rachel-grey-b69319_after-six-months-out-of-tech-my-primary-ugcPost-7383907826374582272-yCCs">private, sorry</a>): "one month off per year of service is a good rule of
thumb; after six of them, I'm still feeling like a sailor who just barely
managed to swim to shore." Maybe that's still where I'm at too.</p>
<p>So what have I been doing?  I'm prioritizing friends and family — I'm
lucky to have a lot of people I care about. I'm embarrassed that I haven't
always been good about staying in touch, but I can fix that now. And fun stuff
like <a href="https://planet-bridge.org/index.php">bridge lessons</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I'm getting involved with a couple of small projects but nothing
serious yet. When I find something interesting, I'll write about it here.</p>

<p>An offer of a Voluntary Exit from Google HR landed in my mailbox right around my
ten-year anniversary with the company, give or take. We'd had a couple of
packages like this at Google before (<a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/">news</a>), basically the same deal you'd
get if you got laid off. But this was the first one put in front of those of us
working in one of the revenue engines of the company — I worked on Search.</p>
<p>I wasn't aiming to leave. I liked the work, I had a good team and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwinton/">boss</a>. But
the package was enough to kickstart a discussion, "why <em>not</em> now?". My wife and
I ran numbers and discussed our futures. I clicked the button. My last day as a
Googler was earlier this week, October 4th.</p>
<p>I have good feelings about my time at Google. It was nice that I saw a some
different parts of the business: some consumer (three years at YouTube, four
years at Search) and some enterprise (three years at Cloud). I got to play with
big infrastructure and solve some hard problems. I saw behind the curtain. But
the best part was the smart and interesting people I got to work with. I know
it's a cliche, but it's the truth.</p>
<p>Not everything was great. I've decided to not use this space for dishy stories
about how Google isn't all it claims to be. But I sure do love reminiscing and
grousing as much as any engineer. If you want to share war stories over a beer,
I'm always up for that.</p>
<p>What's next? I haven't decided if this is retirement, or a sabbatical, or
something else. I've been off work for extended stretches twice before, once by
choice and once not. Those two times taught me that the difference between a
wonderful, mind-expanding time and a stress-fest is my own mindset. And now
that I haven't been really working for six weeks now, I can confidently say
that my mindset is positive and good.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the next phase. I feel fortunate to have some time to focus on
what's important.</p>

<p>I liked the question that I got when interviewing at YouTube in 2015. At Google
then we'd have an interview panel of four or five people, each assigned to cover
a different area. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billy-biggs-7ab1023/">Billy Biggs</a> was the TL on my panel asked to evaluate
"architecture." For a manager candidate that mostly meant evaluating technical
cluefulness (someone else had me do some simple <a href="201205fizzbuzz-for-managers">programming</a>).</p>
<p>Billy's question: <strong>Discuss what would cause a Python interpreter to crash. Not
a <em>program written in Python</em>, but the interpreter itself.</strong></p>
<p>I remember this leading to a fun, rambling, back-and-forth discussion of the
<strong>ways computers can fail</strong>. There are so many! Every level of the stack can
fail in interesting ways: storage, RAM, memory management, networking. How would
a bit flip in a TLB manifest? How does TCP/IP detect and handle ordering?
collisions?</p>
<p>We also covered a bunch of <strong>engineering and process questions</strong>. How is the
interpreter itself implemented, in what language and by whom? What would the
quality processes be like for a product like that, especially given Python is
presumably a really large open source project? How would you manage this? How
important to quality is the role of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">BDFL</a>? </p>
<p>And then that lead to a some more interesting higher-level discussions about the
actual <strong>costs and benefits of addressing failures</strong> like these in the field.
When should programs hard-fail versus detect and recover? How would you staff an
engineering team to find and chase down errors? What's the user impact to a
failure like this?</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about this question is most likely it was something
they'd actually seen right in their backyard. In 2015 significant parts of
YouTube was <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-December/070323.html">written in Python</a> (that's likely not the case anymore, I don't
know). Crashes like these must have come up in the field. Not only are
real-world problems relatively easy to ask, but they have the added benefit of
showing the candidate the kinds of issues that the team actually deals with. It's
also a well-shaped question: open ended, no right/wrong answers.</p>
<p>I got the job.</p>

<p>This is a story about how hard it is to come up with a good name.</p>
<p>This was in 2013. I was part of a team building a <a href="201207on-line-education/">system for online
education</a> at Stanford. We <a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-launches-class2go-open-source-platform-online-classes">launched</a> a nice little site,
Class2Go, with a small team in a few months. It worked well and
supported the basic features of an online course: videos, assessments,
auth, reporting. We decided to keep it going and worked on it for
another year, expanding the covered use cases and taking on more
classes.</p>
<p>But even from the beginning the name <em>Class2Go</em> felt a bit off. Our
original aim was to enable offline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> students, people trying
to take classes offline or in poorly-connected places But we ended
up pivoting away from the offline use case to more standard
hosted-course features. It became a little multi-tenant CMS with a
small database for auth, assessment results, and some basic analytics.</p>
<p>We decided to rebrand. Someone knew a naming consultant, presumably
an alum, and soon enough we had an expert on board. They were really
interesting to work with. After understanding the platform's goals
and features, they generated hundreds of candidate names. Each was
vetting for domain name availability and copyright conflicts. The
consultant was good at their job, bringing us something like a hundred
candidate names (I wish I still had that list).</p>
<p>One name caught everyone's attention: <strong>Tindra</strong>. It's a Swedish
word that means "sparkle" or "twinkle." It's evocative and easy to
say. It also happens to be a woman's name, but not a particularly
common one we were told. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, <code>tindra.com</code> was available! In 2013 short and catchy
domain names were getting hard to come The <a href="https://newgtldprogram.icann.org/">new gTLD program</a> had
only just been approved in 2012, and <code>.com</code> and <code>.org</code> were pretty
crowded.</p>
<p>The problem was that if you Googled "tindra," the top result was a
Swedish adult film actress! Not good. Maybe with enough SEO juice,
over time, we would have overtaken that. But on launch day, that's
not the association you want to have.</p>
<p>We ended up punting on the problem and going with a generic name,
<strong>Stanford Online</strong>. It got the job done, but felt like a missed
opportunity. We later merged with edX and <a href="leaving-stanford/">I found another job</a>.
Eventually the team re-branded the site with the name <strong><a href="https://online.stanford.edu/lagunita-learning-platform">Lagunita</a></strong>,
the name of the lake on campus, which they're still using today. I
like it.</p>
<p>I admit I still have a thing for Tindra though. The name, not the actress.</p>
<p>Postscript: <code>tindra.com</code> still doesn't seem to be used for anything
today. It looks to just be parked by a German domain registrar.
Google results don't seem to be a problem. Maybe it's available for
something interesting?</p>

<p><em>What's the value of an experiment or a prototype?</em></p>
<p>There are all kinds of ways to have impact. A feature can improve user
experience; a hardening project can reduce risk of a production outage;
refactoring or test coverage can improve velocity or make software easier and
safer to maintain. And good engineers care a lot about impact. While it's not
the only thing that matters (the "how" is important too), if you start with
impact, you'll generally do well.</p>
<p>An engineer's job to put ideas into practice, to make things. But sometimes
we're not sure what to make. Or we think we know, but aren't sure it'll work.
The best way to figure that out is often running a set of experiments, or maybe
building a prototype (an n=1 experiment).</p>
<p>But crucially, an experiment doesn't have value itself. An experiment is
successful only if we've learned something. The intent of the test rig or
prototype isn't to live on. Indeed, knowing that we plan to throw it away is
part of what makes it fast and cheap to build, and it shouldn't have all the
trappings of production-quality software, like test coverage and code reviews.</p>
<p>So how do we ensure that value gets delivered? When you work in a team or a
company people turn over. It's not just enough to do the experiment, you need to
write it up and share your results. To produce a good writeup, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Figure out the hypothesis(es)</strong> you're testing. Often this is in the form
   of one or more questions. For prototypes, it might be a boolean, i.e. we can
   build X that will work. But even then, consider what "done" means. Stating
   your hypothesis in terms of a metric is often easiest. NB I find the
   goal/driver/guardrail framework from Thanks <a href="https://research.google/people/author3770/?&amp;type=google">Diane</a>'s book helpful,
   <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trustworthy_Online_Controlled_Experiment/TFjPDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1">Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>State your assumptions and method</strong>. This is where you usually get the most
   feedback. Note that this usually isn't a project plan, as your reviewers
   usually don't care how long it takes or what happens when. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seek feedback</strong> from your peers. Publish the doc stating the method to have
   smart people poke holes in your plan and make sure what you're measuring will
   actually address the hypothesis. And then when the experiment is done, get it
   reviewed by someone senior to ensure that your work supports your conclusion.
   This also spreads knowledge about this work (both that you're doing it, and
   the results) so the overall organization benefits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The artifact produced has many benefits. It's useful for you as you discuss
follow-on work; it's useful come performance evaluation time. But most
importantly, it benefits the organization. Contemporary and future peers can
learn from this work. </p>
<p>You'll benefit from taking the time to write it up, the reviewers learn from
reading, and it'll live on past your time with the team.</p>
