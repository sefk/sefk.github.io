Some bosses want you to *bring them problems*. They like to unscramble
Rubik's cubes and are happy to work through it with you. Sure it's great if you have a proposal or recommendation,
but be prepared to show your homework.

Other bosses want you to *bring them solutions*. If you
bring them a problem, you'll get annoyance and "what do you want
me to do about it?"

Most bosses have exceptions by domain. A common patter there is the
techie bring-me-problems boss who'll want to dig in on capacity
planning, say, but hope you can solve messy people conflicts yourself.

I've worked with both and each has their virtues. When you have a new
boss, figure out what type they are and adjust.
