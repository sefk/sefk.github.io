Some bosses want you to *bring them problems*. They like to unscramble
Rubik's cubes and are happy to work through it with you. Sure it's great if you have a proposal or recommendation,
but be prepared to show your homework.

Other bosses want you to *bring them solutions*. If you
bring them a problem, you'll get annoyance and "what do you want
me to do about it?"

Most bosses have exceptions by domain. A common pattern there is
the bring-me-problems boss who is also a techie -- they'll want to
dig in planning, say, but prefer you to solve messy people conflicts
yourself.

I've worked with both and each has their virtues. When you have a new
boss, figure out their style and adjust.
