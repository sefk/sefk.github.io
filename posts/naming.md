This is a story about how hard it is to come up with a good name.

This was in 2013 or so when I was part of a team building a [system
for online education][in] at Stanford. We [launched][] a nice little
site, Class2Go, with a small team in a few months. It worked well
and supported the basic features of an online course: videos,
assessments, auth, reporting. We decided to keep it going and worked
on it for another year, expanding the covered use cases and taking
on more classes.

But even from the beginning the name *Class2Go* felt a bit off. Its
original aim was to enable offline [MOOC] students, people trying
to take classes in poorly connected places like low bandwidth
countries or during a commute.  But the thing we actually pivoted
away from the offline use case to more standard hosted-course
features. It became a little multi-tenant CMS with a small database
for auth, assessment results, and some basic analytics.

We decided to rebrand. Someone knew a naming consultant, presumably
an alum, and soon enough we had an expert on board. After understanding
the platform's goals and features, they generated hundreds of
candidate names. Each had gone through some basic vetting for things
like domain name availability and copyright conflicts. They were
good at their job and we had a good list to consider.

One name caught everyone's attention: **Tindra**. It's a Swedish
word that means "sparkle" or "twinkle." It's evocative and easy to
say. It also happens to be a woman's name, but not a particularly
common one Surprisingly, `tindra.com` was available! In 2013 simple
domain names were getting hard to come by as this was right before
all those new top level domains were created.

The problem was that if you Googled that name the top result was a
Swedish adult film actress! Maybe with enough SEO juice, over time,
we would have overtaken that. But on launch day, that's not the
association you want to have.

We ended up just going with **Stanford Online**, which was fine.
We later merged with edX and [sometime later I left][out]. Sometime
after I'd gone the team re-branded with the name **[Lagunita][]**,
which they're still using today. It's a pretty good name, but I
admit I still have a thing for Tindra. The name, not the actress.

Postscript: `tindra.com` doesn't seem to be used for anything today.
It looks to just be parked by a German domain registrar. Google
results don't seem to be a problem. Maybe it's available for something
interesting?
