This is a story about how hard it is to come up with a good name.

This was in 2013 or so when I was building a [system for online
education at Stanford][s]. We started in 2012 and [launched][] a
nice little site, Class2Go, with a small team in a few months. The
site worked well and supported the basic features of an online
course well enough: videos, assessments, auth, reporting. We decided
to keep it going and worked on it for another year, expanding the
covered use cases and taking on more classes.

But even from the beginning the name *Class2Go* felt a bit off. The
original product's aim was to enable offline [MOOC] students. The
target users were people trying to take classes in poorly connected
places, like low bandwidth countries or a commuter train. But the
thing we actually built didn't support the offline use case well
anymore. In the process of getting to launch we kinda pivoted into
a more basic online-ed course system and away from the on-the-go
aspect. It was more like a little CMS backed by a database for
logins and assessment results.

We decided to rebrand @emdash; let's bring in a naming consultant.
Someone knew someone, presumably an alum, and soon enough we had
an expert on board.  After talking to us to understand the platform's
goals and features, they generated hundreds of candidate names.
Each had gone through some basic vetting for things like domain
name availability and copyright conflicts.  They were good at their
job and we had a good list.

One name caught everyone's attention: ***Tindra***. It's a
Swedish word that means "sparkle" or "twinkle." It's evocative and
easy to say. It's a woman's name. Surprisingly, `tindra.com` was
available! In 2013 simple domain names were getting hard to come
by, as this was right before all those new top level domains came
on line.

The problem was that if you Googled that name the top result was a
Swedish adult film actress. Maybe with enough SEO juice, over time,
we would have overtaken that. But on launch day, that's not the
association you want to have.

We ended up just going with **Stanford Online**, which was fine.
And then after we merged with edX and sometime after I left that
job, the team re-branded with the **[Lagunita][]** name that they're
still using today. It's a pretty good name, but I admit I still
have a thing for Tindra. The name, not the actress.

Postscript: `tindra.com` doesn't seem to be used for anything today.
It looks to just be parked by a German domain registrar. Google
results don't seem to be a problem. Maybe it's available for something
interesting?
