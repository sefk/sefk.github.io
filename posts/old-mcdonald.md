This tweet got me wondering: how many others meet the same critera?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact: If Celine Dion sang only the vowels in her name, it would be in the lyrics to Old McDonalds Farm.</p>&mdash; Fran (@whingewine) <a href="https://twitter.com/whingewine/status/1764970794625515667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Googling around found a [stack overflow question][s] where someone
helpfully harvested a [list][l] of about 4,000 people that's good
enough for this. Grepping turned up four candidates with the vowels
in the right order, but some with confounding vowels.

```
Celine Dion
Eddie Cleanhead Vinson
Jennifer Aniston
Leslie Twiggy Lawson
```

[Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson][e] meets the bill if we don't consider
his nickname. He was a jazz musician who lived from 1917-88 &mdash;
I think I'll check him out. And TIL Twiggy's real name.
