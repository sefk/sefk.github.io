Values are useful. 
thirty years as an engineering manager has been in big companies, trying to
get people to do things, and I've used values one of the quickest ways to
do that. It gets peoples attention; it can bring an unruly or noncommital
peer to heel.

### Example At A Big Company -- Google



### An Example -- Groups.IO


I'm writing to recommend a good vendor, [Groups.IO][]. They are a mailing list
company. If you have a group of people that you want to to keep in touch with,
they can provide basic mailing list features. The free tier is pretty
reasonable, up to 100 subscribers and only basic features. Then if you need
bigger lists, or fancy features, they'll upsell a premium offer.

Why not just Google Groups? I basically believe their claim that Google Groups
has gone long in the tooth. It works but it's been a long time since it's gotten
improvements. '

For me the main driver was that it *wasn't Google*. The need to create a Google
ID is a pretty big barrier for some people, either for philosophical or
technical reasons. Amongst the group of people I was hoping to reach, a
not-small number has some trouble with their Google account before, and having
to sort that out was a big barrier. 

There are two things in particular that cause me to write a special post.

### 1. Do One Thing Well

They offer this basic mailing list service and do it really well. Their service
is fast, featureful, robust. Because it's the most important thing the company
does, they take it seriously and it shows.

Now they do have a bunch of higher-value things like calendars and shared
databases. I confess I didn't try those, and I don't begrudge them for expanding
up the stack. But you don't *have* to use those, and the upsell isn't too pesky.

### 2. The Premium Trial is Well Behaved

This is really the unique thing that motivated this post. I wasn't sure that I
needed the premium service, so I signed up for a free trial. The thing that was
a pleasant surprise was when the trial period ended, it fell back to the
standard. The email I got from them is included below, with the key sentence
highlighted in yellow.

When was the last time you saw a service do this at then end of the free trial?
I can't remember one. It's great.

What's so great about this is that it sends strong signal that **this company puts
the user first**. I can imagine the pitch from the person at the company responsible
for
