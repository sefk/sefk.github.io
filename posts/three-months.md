I've been [off work](/posts/leaving-google) for about three months now. It's a
good occasion to take stock of how that's going. In a word, it's been **great**.

* I'm surprised how much lighter my mood is. It feels like a weight that I've
  been carrying around for some time is no longer there. It's different than
  being on vacation, better actually. I didn't appreciate how stressful
  tech management has been all these years.

* I'm taking a ton of pleasure in simple things. I go grocery shopping almost
  every day, I'm doing a ton of cooking.

* It feels good to get healthier. I had knee surgery and am recovering from that
  just fine. I exercise nearly every day. On days that I don't go to [the
  gym][] I do thirty minutes on the bike.

* It's great to have flexibility. I hadn't planned to see my Dad on his 80th
  birthday because we'd on a bigger group thing later. But on a whim I drove
  down and took him out for breakfast on his actual birthday, because why not.

* If I didn't want to do it before, I still don't want to do it. The closet
  hasn't gotten cleaned out; neither has the garage.

My friend Rachel Grey has a three month head start on me leaving Google. Her
writing this resonates with me. Especially [this from a recent LinkedIn
post][rg]: "I heard on the retired-Googlers mailing list that one month off per
year of service is a good rule of thumb; after six of them, I'm still feeling
like a sailor who just barely managed to swim to shore." Maybe that's still
where I'm at too.

So what have I been doing?  I'm prioritizing friends and family &mdash; I'm
lucky to have a lot of people I care about. I'm embarrassed that I haven't
always been good about staying in touch, but I can fix that now. And fun stuff
like [bridge lessons].

Beyond that, I'm getting involved with a couple of small projects but nothing
serious yet. When I find something interesting, I'll write about it here.
