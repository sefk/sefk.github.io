Thick apps won on mobile, fine.

But on the laptop the model is still undecided. Every so often I give thick apps a try: Excel instead
of Google Sheets; Mail.app isntead of GMail. Unfortunately every time I give a thick app a try they
shoot themselves in the foot. The error message to the right is what you see now when you run Excel
untethered. Sure you can click through the warning, but would a newbie know to do so? Seems pretty
disorienting and offputting.

I see hope from the Internet. The **[Chrome][]** browser's auto updates are brilliant. I've never seen
behind the curtain, but I assure you that the key to making auto-updates palatable is solid quality
engineering: design and code reviews, tons of test coverage across many scenarios, diverse and
well-instrumented canaries, thorough perf and resource utilization modeling. If this wasn't so thorough
we wouldn't accept their frequent pushes, and without a frequent and timely upgrade cycle, the browser
innovation cycle would stink.

**[Electron][]** is another bright spot. This framework that gives Slack and Github's clients their
desktop fit and finish. It's almost as good. Right-clicking still doesn't do what I want, and text
controls still are finicky, but it's close, and with it you get nice updates and clean integration.
