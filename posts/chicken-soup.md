My family hasn't avoided the colds that are going around now. My
way of fighting back is making chicken noodle soup.  It's not too
hard, it's satisfying, and it tastes great. [The recipe][r] belongs
to [Peninsula School][p] and gets used at our annual Craft Fair.
It's benefited from years of refinement.

I add more salt. I don't do peas. I've tried with rice but it
got starchy and weird, stick with egg noodles.
