If you're traveling, you're probably used to buying a SIM card for
local data and calls. There's a nice ecosystem with a wealth of
easy and affordable Pay As You Go (PAYG) options.

But the newer iPhones did away with the SIM slot if favor of some new
eSIM hotness. Apple has all kinds of [info][] claiming they have good
international support, but I found reality falls short.

*  Only a few carriers support eSIM's,
*  The few that do require a contract. A tourist or student
   studying abroad is better served by a PAYG plan, and
*  Even if you can stomach a contract, that would require a UK bank
   account; no way to easily pull that off.

We ended up falling back to [international roaming][a]. It works but
is expensive.

I think Apple made the wrong call removing the trusty old SIM tray.
Clearly the new models can be made to work well with it, since how
they are sold in the UK.  If you're unlucky enough to have bought
your recent iPhone in the US, you're out of luck. 

I this is an example of Apple bad tendency sometimes choose form
over function, "[courage][]" over usability.
