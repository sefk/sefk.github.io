<p>It's been nice having AI tools at the ready for cleanup work. You know, those
tasks that require a little program or script. Sure you can write it yourself,
but it won't be fun, and it'll take some time, so instead you just don't bother
and it doesn't get done.</p>
<p>Instead of just knocking this out I decided this would be a fun one to try with
the two tools I'm using the most these days, <strong>Gemini</strong> and <strong>Claude</strong>. I can't
really call this a proper bakeoff, since it's just those two and it's not an
especially hard task.</p>
<p><strong>And the result? Both did well but Gemini did a little better.</strong> Gemini got it
right on the first try; Claude had two bugs that were easy to find and fix.
Claude was a little nicer to work with and produced a nicer description of the
solution. Aside from that, the end product was identical.</p>
<h3>The Task</h3>
<p>I wanted to clean up the some of the old files backing this blog. I migrated the
site from Wordpress to Nikola in 2013. Even back then I <a href="../switching-to-static.md">complained
about</a> the crufty file format, but couldn't be
bothered to fix it then.</p>
<p>The prompt describes in a fair bit of detail what I wanted done. Probably too
much detail. It's down at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>The best way to see what they did is to just look at the resulting commits:
<a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/4a91a57dc965b1e77c05fafbc05fa14f1a293c7f">Gemini</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/78cee0789d98677c5298df543e895d7e2002ff72">Claude</a>. They're pretty similar. I asked both to save
their work in a <code>migration_scripts</code> subdirectory, including a it's own summary
of the work and full log.</p>
<p>For both tools I pay the $20/month that gives me access to reasonable token
limits and good production models -- Gemini 3 and Sonnet 4.6.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Claude</h3>
<p>I didn't describe the problem as "Wordpress-style naming" but Claude sussed that
out. Honestly I'd forgotten that was the source of the problem. Nice!</p>
<p>I like that Claude inserted comments in the configuration file without being
asked to.</p>
<p>Despite being told to test, there were two bugs that I had to find.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some of redirects broken. I pointed the problem out and it did more thorough
  testing using <code>curl</code> and found the problem. The new format was what Gemini
  came up with in the first pass (luck? smarts?).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A missing newline between the metadata and the body caused the hero images
  to be dropped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="side by side view showing bug" src="../../f/cleanup-missing-hero.png"></p>
<h3>Thoughts on Gemini</h3>
<p>I haven't used the Gemini CLI as much by this point. It seems to have borrowed
much of it's UI and flow from Claude code (slash commands, asking questions as
it goes) so it's familiar. It's really nice to use, just a smidgen less mature
and polished than Gemini.</p>
<p>I preferred Claude's writeup a little so I went with that one. But Gemini wins
the prize for nailing the task on the first try!</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>I really liked how Claude shows how much of it's context window is used via the
<code>/context</code> command. I had a harder time getting this kind of thing out of
Gemini, and even when I did it was harder to grok.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell with either if I'm getting close to any global usage limits. I
should hope not, this wasn't a very big job.</p>
<h5>Claude <code>/context</code> Output</h5>
<p><img alt="Claude context window usage" src="../../f/claude-context.png"></p>
<h5>Gemini <code>/stats model</code> Output</h5>
<p><img alt='Gemini "stats for nerds"' src="../../f/gemini-context.png"></p>
<h3>Prompt</h3>
<p>Both started with this:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block">First read DEV.md for context about this web site.

In the posts subdirectory are many files that follow an old 
naming convention.  Please convert them all to the new file
naming convention.

The old convention has files of the format YYYYMM&lt;slug&gt;.SUFFIX,
where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and SUFFIX is html or
meta. &lt;slug&gt; is the short form of the the title, and should match
the "slug" field in the metadata

To convert to the new convention

1. Drop the YYYYMM file prefix

2. Combine the "html" and "meta" files into one markdown file
   with a "md" suffix. The contents of "meta" are at the top of
   the file as an HTML comment

3. Add redirects so the old names can still be served. Add tuples
   in the REDIRECTIONS of conf.py

Use the `nikola build` and `nikola serve` commands to test your
work. Make sure all old URL's still function. Make sure pages
look the same. Make sure tags still work.

Do not commit changes. Do not push to production.
</pre></div>

<p>I also checked in a <a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/blob/dev/DEV.md"><code>DEV.md</code></a> file that described the purpose, directory
layout, and some constraints. Again, maybe overkill, but I figured this isn't
the last time I'll be asking one of these tools to help me futz with this site.</p>
