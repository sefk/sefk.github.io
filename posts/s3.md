Do you all appreciate how insanely cheap and easy-to-use S3 is? I
use it for home backups, and you should too.  I have about 72,000
photos and short home movies that are basically priceless to me.
All told I need about 400 GB of online storage to back this up.
Doing this cost-effectively with established online backup services
(Mozy, Carbonite) is expensive, as is buying that much live storage
from Google or Dropbox.  But using the method here, I only have to
pay about $6/month to keep them safe and sound.

S3 is Amazon's [Simple Storage Service][s3], part of Amazon Web
Services.  It's a document store. It is reliable and has basically
infinite capacity, enough for your and my needs. The GUI is pretty
clunky, but that's fine, because the API is useful (I prefer the
Python language binding via [Boto][boto]) and the command line is
decent. [Glacier][gl] is cold-storage well-integrated into S3. You
specify a bucket policy, say move to glacier after 10 days, and it
gets archived. Once archived it costs something to get out (at more
than some rate). That's OK, this is just for backup. If you ever 
need to get data out, you'll be happy to do it slowly or pay the 
premium.

There are good services out there (e.g. [Tarsnap][ts]) that layer
some management tools and encryption on top of S3 (and presumably
Glacier). I wouldn't be surprised if they even simplify the management
of policy, like Glacier rules or folder exclusions. I'm not using
those because there's anything wrong with them, I just find the
basic dumb way sufficient for my needs.

OK, with that out of the way, this is how to do set it up yourself:

1. Sign up for AWS.  Assuming you have an account with Amazon 
   already, just go [here and sign up][aws].

   [aws]: http://aws.amazon.com/

2. Download and install the command line tools for Amazon.  These
   instructions are written to use the [s3cmd][cmd] utility 
   just because that's what I've been using for a while.  The nicer
   [Amazon command line tools][cli] now support rsync, so that would
   probably be nicer, so consider that.  Both tools have nice support 
   for storing credentials in a dotfile, read the instructions for that.  
 
   [cmd]: http://s3tools.org/s3cmd
   [cli]: http://aws.amazon.com/cli/

3. Create a bucket, name it anything.  The namespace of buckets
   is globally shared, so the name "pictures" is certainly already 
   taken, but "jones-picture-vault" is likely fine.

    Set up bucket permissions to automatically send data to glacier. 
    I see no reason to have it live in S3 any longer than necessary, 
    so I just send it straight to the freezer. I guess you could have 
    it live in S3 limbo for a week for cheaper testing if you want.

4. Sync you photo library.  From a shell:

    <pre>
    cd ~
    s3cmd -v sync iPhoto\ Library/. s3://my-bucket-name
    </pre>

    It's a quirk of my setup that I use s3cmd to do the sync, and not
    the aws cli that I asked you to install/run above.  Basically, I use
    the aws cli for works stuff, and s3cmd for personal.  That means I
    can store one set of credentials in my ~/.s3cmd file, and another in
    ~/.boto.  They both work fine.

5. It's easy enough to set up as a cron job to run weekly or so.  Me,
   I just run by hand, usually after coming home from a trip with
   a slew of new photos. Why not run more often? Because the sync
   seems to touch many (all?) of the files in Glacier, and accesses
   cost money.  I haven't calculated, but maybe it's $1.00 per
   backup for me -- not too much, but would break the bank if yout
   did it daily.

There are other articles describing this on sites like [LifeHacker][lh]
and [such][tg]. My instructions are pretty spare. If you get stuck
try looking at those. I would just not bother with the fancy UI's
and just do via the command line. But that's just me.
