<p>
It's been nearly eleven years since 9/11 and I still think about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_M._Lewin" target="_blank">Danny</a> fairly often. Sometimes I think about the wife, sons, family, and friends that he left behind. I'm sure they miss him terribly.

<p>
More often, though, I think of how his life relates to mine. We were about the same age in 2001, but not peers. I was an engineer at his company, Akamai.  He was a force of nature.

<p>
So when I think of Danny, I think about...

<p>
<ul>
	<li>how much he did in his thirty-one years.</li>
	<li>all the great things that have happened to me since I was thirty-one. Two wonderful kids, amazing life experiences with my lovely wife, good career stuff.</li>
	<li>what a positive, can-do outlook accomplish. Both for yourself and others. Danny had that in spades.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If I was able to ask Danny how to best honor him, I think he'd tell me something amazing with urgency. He'd then kick me in the pants to go do it.
