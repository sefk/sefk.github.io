There are a few personal technology tribes -- the main ones I can think of
are Google's, Apple's, and Microsoft's (maybe there's an open-source one
too?). For me, what's worked for a lon time has been be half in the Google
tribe, and half in Apple's.

I have many **Apple Devices**: iPhone, Mac desktops and laptops, AppleTV,
Watch. I use a very few Apple apps and services, like Photos, and I've played
with Music. Generally I find Apple shared services, like Photo Sharing, to be
unreliable/slow and confusing. Doing apps over the Internet just isn't Apple
DNA.

I use **Google Internet Apps**, like Docs, Sheets, Gmail, Calendar (both
personal and shared), Drive. Google's is all about fast and reliable. I find
their products very usable, but that's because they seem to be tailored for a
nerd like me (example: vi keybindings in Gmail), and I'm willing to look past
the limitations of browser based apps (see my recent [post about thick
apps](/posts/thick-apps.html).)

I sure do love those Apple devices, and I sure do love those Google services.
