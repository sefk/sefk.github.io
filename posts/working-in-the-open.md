The other day my daughter asked me about Software Engineering -- what do
we _actually do_? She's eighteen and probably won't follow in my
footsteps, which is fine, but I still want her to see my field.

I've always found this question hard to answer. I've been an engineering
manager for a long time, and I'm happy to describe that job (emails,
1:1's, PRD reviews), but I don't think that's the heart of it. Plus
these days I work for Google where things there are proprietary and
deeply layered, not much help for answering questions like these.

Recently I've found my way to Mastodon for [obvious reasons][r]. I
chose the [Hachyderm][] instance because it was well run by people who
shared my values. It turns out that the values of the owners and
operators of the things we use matter, huh.

I then learned a cool thing, that the Hachyderm admins do much of their
work publicly. They livestream debugging sessions on [Twitch][], they write
postmortems, they share live [graphs][]. [@nova][] happened to be
live-streaming at that moment, not surprising since the team's been busy
absorbing thousands of new users and fending off attacks. My daughter
and I watched a bit together.

Team Hachyderm ([@nova][] [@dma][] [@quintessence][] [@Taniwha][]
[@hazelweakly][] [@malte][]): thank you for running this service well.
But also thank you for giving me something I'm proud to use and proud to
show my kid.
