</div>

I turned off comments on this blog today. Nobody had posted a comment in a long
time, and the only reason I'd kept them on all these years were to continue to
show a couple of comments on some very old posts.

Why? Because [Disqus], the provider lo these many years, has gone down the
[Enshittification][] path. They started running a bunch of link-spam in place of
the comment box. Of course they did. I captured a screenshot, which you can
[take a peek at][ss]. Boo.

Shame on me for entrusting this company to handle content for my personal site
in the first place. Isn't that the whole point of writing and maintaining an
old-school blog? Sigh.
