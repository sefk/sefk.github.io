I turned off comments on this site today. Up 'til now the good people at
[Disqus][] had provided me with a free service for commenting that had worked
well for ten-plus years.

Why? Because Disqus appears to have gone down the [enshittification][] path.
They started running a bunch of link-spam right above the comment box on all my
pages. Of course they did. I captured a [screenshot][] if you want to see, boo.

Shame on me for entrusting a company to handle content for my personal site in
the first place. Isn't controlling things the whole point of this old-school
blog business? Not a big loss, nobody had posted a comment in a long time. But
still.
