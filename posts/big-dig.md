I just finished listening to the [Big Dig podcast][p] and it's worth
a listen. It's about Boston's [Central Artery/Tunnel Project][wb],
the most expensive highway project in US history. It covers the
whole story, from conception, to getting it approved, to years of
execution, and then the fallout from cost overruns and mismanagement.
The podcast is well produced and has a lot of primary-source
interviews.

I have a little bit of a personal connection, since I lived in
Boston during those later years and it was on the news _all the
time_. I even got a tour of a part when it was under construction.

I like how they use this story to speak to something larger: can
America build big infrastructure anymore? It's something I think
lot about. We benefit from by the giant projects from the past
(dams, bridges, interstates) but struggle to maintain them properly today.
We struggle to do new things like proper [high-speed rail][wc].

Their claim is this is partially due to headwinds that didn't exist
in the public-works heydey in the twentieth century. Leaders are
under much more scrutiny; projects fall under many new regulations
protecting the environment and worker safety. While the old way was
faster and cheaper, it also caused a lot of harm. Public works
projects are so big and disruptive that high cost and long times
are likely unavoidable.

It ends on a hopeful note. Not that it's easy, nor are we necessarily
that much better managing big projects now. But there are success
stories.

I especially liked an interview [20 minutes into the final episode][o]
with [Fred Salvucci][fs]. He tells the story Saint Francis. God tells
Francis to build a cathedral, but then keeps tears it down. Why?
because it's not enough to build a physical cathedral, but you also
have to build the support for it in the hearts and minds of the
people. Maybe that's the part that we're not doing well enough these
days and is blocking our ability to build big things.
