<p>Sponsorship is about advocacy. A sponsor uses their position and influence
(candidly, their <em>power</em>) to help someone get ahead. Or, if you're on the
receiving end of this, you're asking someone powerful to speak up for you when
and where it matters.</p>
<p>Sponsorship is distinct from <a href="../mentoring">Mentorship</a> in that it's not
nearly the same level of involvement. There's not an expectation that you'll
work through problems together over a long timeframe. But you are asking for a
sponsor for their time to engage with you and your work. More importantly,
you're asking them to put their reputation on the line for you, even if just a
little bit, by being your advocate.</p>
<p>Does asking sponsorship feel a little unseemly? I admit it used to feel that way
to me, like grubbing for grades or "being political." Now I see it as being
thoughtful about how decisions are actually made.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.carlaspearls.com/">Carla Harris</a> writes and speaks well on this
topic. She gave a talk at Google in 2022 that made an impression on me. (Here's
a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE_W50OTUc">2019 TED Talk</a> that hits a lot
of the same points.) Her own candid way of talking about this consider it much
more actively myself, and willing to talk about with others.</p>
<h4>Maybe You're Going Up For Promotion</h4>
<p>With this in mind, let's apply this to promotions.</p>
<p>Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias these decisions, they are complicated
and are made by real-world humans. Organizations look to their senior people to
bring their experience, knowledge, and judgment to bear.</p>
<p>Consider how the promotion decision will be made for your case. One key
questions is <strong>who will in the room</strong>? This isn't just who is invited and who
will attend, but more who will be <strong>influential</strong> in the discussion and decision
making process, and <strong>for what</strong>. Not everyone has an equal voice.</p>
<p>Say you're an engineer going up for promotion to Senior. Then likely a senior
Tech Lead (not necessarily <em>your</em> Tech Lead!) will be asked to speak to the
quality of your work (e.g. good code, considered alternatives, futureproofing).
A senior manager will likely be asked to assess how well you worked with others
and made good decisions. And these are just two of the factors — there
will be many others depending on your role and level. You need to work down the
rubric and think through all the levers.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might know who the key person will be but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.</p>
<p>And then as you identify those key people, assess their level of support. This
may be something you can do yourself (if you have a relationship already) or
maybe you'll need your manager's help. But somehow you need to ask them, as
candidly as you can, "If asked about X, what will you say?" It can sometimes be
hard to get an honest answer, so you may need to push a little. Reassure them
you'd much rather know now if you have their support or not and you're not going
to hold it against them.</p>
<p>If you don't have their support yet, that's OK. Think about work you can do that
to change that.</p>
<h4>Day-To-Day Decisions</h4>
<p>Not all decisions are as high-stakes as promotions. Leaders make decisions all
the time, like whom to trust to lead a project or run a meeting. I like to think
about these small-but-important decisions too in the context of sponsorship. Is
your manager your sponsor? What about your TL?</p>
