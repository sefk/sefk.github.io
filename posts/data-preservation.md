I think most people would agree that it's a good think for our government to
produce and curate [public goods][], things like navigation aids, roads, and
water treatment infrastructure. Me, I put data into that same category. It's
important for us to all have good common maps, standard sets of facts about our
natural world, or datasets of economic things. That's a good thing for our
government to be doing, right?

Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard about the current US government
administration's efforts to actually _remove data_. Or at least they've been
trying to: websites and datasets have been taken down, presumably because they
didn't line up with administration priorities or viewpoints. This is scary,
dystopian stuff. If you want to know more, check out this [Wikipedia page][] on
dataset removals, or read assessments from professional organizations, like this
one from the [American Statistical Association][].

In early 2025, when things started happening, the [Data Rescue Project][] sprang
into action. They're a group of concerned academics, librarians, and citizens
who have been copying and cataloging and storing datasets so it doesn't
disappear and to make sure it's findable later.  The [project's press page] has
links to many articles and presentations that talk about their work and its
impact.

I found out about them on a mailing list of ex-Googlers. Someone posted
a call for volunteers.
