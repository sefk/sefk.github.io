I was so disappointed in Oppenheimer. It wasn't terrible, but what
a missed opportunity.

**Mystifying**. Part of the job of a biopic is to give you insight
into what a person is thinking and feeling. Especially for this
movie, which is basically about this question: what would it be
like to be the person who made these terrible weapons?  I understand
he's complicated, and _it's_ complicated.  But instead of dialog,
or even some outright explaining, this movie leans on of Cillian
Murphy staring into the distance or adjusting his hat.

**Women**. There were plenty of interesting women they could have
brought in, either contemporaries, or from academia, or the
Manhattan project itself. There are only two women in the movie:
one is a sex object with mental health issues (Pugh); the other is
a mother/lush with a surprisingly sharp wit, but only for a minute
(Blunt). The sex scene, oddly using Oppenheimer's most famous line,
was gratuitous and super weird.

**Strauss**. I'm not invested at all in the conflict with [Admiral
Strauss][s]. Paraphrasing the good folks at [The Incomparable][i], "I
don't care if some guy becomes Commerce Secretary in the Eisenhower
Cabinet."

Given how much I like the [history and the science][m] of this
period, I was really pulling for this movie. Dang.
