I was so disappointed in Oppenheimer. It wasn't terrible, but what
a missed opportunity.

**Mystifying**. Part of the job of a movie like this is to give you
insight into what the person is thinking and feeling.  Especially
in this case -- what would it be like to be the person who made
these terrible weapons? That's really what I wanted to get from
this movie.  I understand he's complicated, and _it's_ complicated.
But instead of dialog, or even some outright explaining, this movie
leans on of Cillian Murphy staring into the distance or adjusting his hat.

**Women**. There were plenty of interesting women around  -- in
academia, in the Manhattan project, in relationships. There are
only two women in the movie: one is a sex object with mental health
issues (Pugh); the other is a mother/lush with a surprisingly sharp
tongue and wit, but only for a minute (Blunt). The sex scene, quoting
Oppenheimer's most famous line, was gratuitous and super weird.

**Strauss**. I'm not invested at all in the conflict with Admiral
Strauss. Paraphrasing the commentary on this by the good folks at
[The Incomparable][i], "I don't care if some guy becomes Commerce
Secretary in the Eisenhower Cabinet."

Given how much I like the [history and the science][m] of this
period, I really pulling for this movie. Dang.
