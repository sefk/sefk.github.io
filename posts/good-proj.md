If you find yourself with some extra time, find a good open source project to
contribute to. 

There's really two things at work here: why it's a good project to contribute
to, and why it's been a good project *for me*. 

Good project

* Clueful tech team. Helpful

* Triaged bug list

* Open development: standups, retrospectives


Good for me

* New tech stack

*
