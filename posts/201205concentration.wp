I've lost my ability to concentrate. I knew this before I started <a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/2012/04/my-sabbatical/">my time off</a>, but thought it wasn't so bad. Hey, maybe it's actually a sign of being a good multitasker. Obviously, that is crap.

Now that I'm on sabbatical and I really need to concentrate. The external distractions I can deal with: shut off email and IM, take the editor full screen. What has me concerned is even with those tricks I still have a hard time. It's me. My mind wanders. I think about of that other thing I was going to do; wonder what's going on with that news thing that has no immediate bearing on me.

As Yoda said, "you must unlearn what you have learned." I'm trying these things:

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Reading. Not blogs, but books. Business stuff is OK, but fiction is better. Best: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deepness_in_the_Sky">dense science fiction</a> -- that requires concentration. I don't view this as entertainment (which it primarily is) but exercise.</li>
	<li>Coding. Anything less than a three hour block of time is almost worthless. But once <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">the Flow</a> comes, it is sooo good.</li>
	<li>Watching lectures. The drier the better.</li>
</ul>
</p>

I'll report back in a month if my concentration is any ... wait, what was I saying?
