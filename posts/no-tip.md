I really don't like tipping. I'm not like [Mr. Pink][pink]. It's
not that I don't want my server or driver to get something extra.
I just don't like the awkward social situation of deciding if this
is a tipping situation, and if so, how much.

Two services have come up recently where I will happily pay a premium
to not have to fret about too much or too little:

* **Uber**. Lots to like about this service but the act of just 
  leaving out of my cab without paying is joyful. I always rate 
  my drivers, good or bad. 98% of the time, it's good by the way.

* **OrderAhead**. Are you supposed to tip when picking up takeout 
  from a restaurant? I've never known. Neither way feels right, so 
  I usually end up splitting the difference and rounding up to 
  some amount, say leaving a 6% tip, which is the *worst* choice. 
  Either that's 6% that wasn't expected, or I'm inadvertently
  shafting someone.

Both of these services decouple feedback from money. Both avoid
awkwardly changing money. I'd definitely pay a premium for that.

I wonder what other service business would benefit from decoupling
feedback from money?
