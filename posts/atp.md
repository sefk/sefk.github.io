I listen to a fair number of podcasts, and the
[Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/) is my favorite by a mile.

It's the one that I look forward to every week. It comes out on
Thursdays, often right when I'm headed home. It kind feels like the
weekend is right around the corner.

Some of the reasons why I like it so much are particular to me --
I'll get those out of the way quickly.

- The foundation, the world of technology and all things around it,
  is right in my wheelhouse. It's my profession, but also my hobby.
  That's what got me in the door, and frankly, if that's not your
  thing, this isn't for you.
- They focus on the Apple products and ecosystem, which where I
  spend a lot of my time.
- But they also cover a lot of issues that touch on the world of
  technology: business, law & politics, companies, social media.
- And they end up talking a lot about personal tech, like how to
  manage family photos (it's hard!) and backups. What's the best
  way to get tech right for aging parents or kids (also hard!).
- I especially like tech-adjacent topics like home audio/video,
  home automation, and gaming.

But in many ways more interesting is not the content, but how
they produce and run their show.

- They are **friends**.
  It's nice hanging out with people who genuinely like each other,
  kind of like we have permission to eavesdrop and share in that
  comeradie.
- They're not afraid to lean into the **lives of their hosts**.
  They have families and work/life stress, and they talk
  about all of that.
- Their show is **exceptionally well produced**. I didn't
  appreciate this until I'd heard so many other podcasts that are terrible
  in this way. They have terrible recording equipment or are poorly mixed.
  The super corporate, fancy podcasts are good, but they also have so many
  ads and are a different kind of show.
- And the show is  **so well edited**. They do so without
  lose any of the content or the pacing, but loses most of the awkward
  and inevitable instances of "um where were we".
- They **don't talk over each other**. Part of this is discipline,
  part of this is just politeness. But listening to the pre-edited
  version sometimes, I understand that some of this is also in the edit.
  Some of those interruptions are willfully edited out.  Nice job Marco.
- They're one of the few podcasts that properly use **chapter markers**.
  Huge quality of life win, bravo.
- They are **respectful**.  They don't put people down, they aren't mean.
  They kid each other, but it's in good fun.
- When (rarely) they've waded into social justice or
  world events, they've done done so respectfully and thoughtfully.
  They understand that as three three cis white guys, it's good to
  have views to share, but also responsibility to listen and help others.
- Their show is **reliable**. It's great that they keep to a format
  and a regular schedule. It becomes part of your life.

Although they joke about how much of the show is devoted to feedback,
it's one of my favorite parts. It shows that they listen and are
learning.  And they share that learning with all of us. A recent,
example was six minutes or so into [Episode 570][a] when I learned
how home power battery systems fiddle with the AC power frequency
(!) to tell solar panels to back off and shed power instead of
producing when full. Fascinating.

I like the members-only specials. It's fine that they extra and you
have to pay something for them.
I like how candid they've been about how ad revenue has dried up
recently and they could use the extra revenue channel. And this is
a nice way to reward members, done without compromising the
core show.

The best thing they ever did was getting a sponsor to send John
toasters to review. And [review he did][t] I didn't appreciate how
many bad toasters there are, and how they can be bad for so many
reasons. My favorite reason was poor [knob feel][k].

Nice work John, Marco, and Casey. Please keep it up for a
long, long time.
