I was fortunate to have had a talk and meal with Rob Reiner some years back. I
wanted to take a moment to share this story on the sad occasion of his death
this week.

It was 2003 or so. I lived and worked for Akamai in Boston.  I went back and
forth to our San Mateo office. There was a red eye from San Jose to Boston that
I'd take home. Back then the San Jose airport was smaller than it is now, and
was especially quiet at the evenings. Flight curfews meant not many flights left
that time of night which means not a lot of dinner options. So McDonald's it
was.

Rob Reiner was in line right in front of me! He was traveling with some
assistant-type person. I tend to not want to bother celebrities in public, but I
was moved to say something.

**Sef**: Hello Mr. Reiner. Forgive me but I just wanted to say how much I enjoy
your work. I'm a really big fan.

He has this big grin and offers his hand.

**Rob Reiner**: Hi! What's your name? Thanks for introducing yourself. What have
I done that you liked?

I don't think this was some admission question, I think he genuinely just wanted
to know. And I know his films pretty well at this point. _When Harry Met Sally_
is his most popular work, but what most people would probably answer would be _A
Few Good Men_. That had been up for Best Picture ten years prior.

**Sef**: _The Princess Bride_, hands down. I love the story and I love what you
did with it.

**Rob Reiner**: I'm glad you said that. That's my favorite too.

I got what I was hoping for at this point. I thanked him and started to beg off
to give him space to order his burger and have dinner in peace. But no. In that
loud, New Yorker voice, he said "C'mon, let's have cheeseburgers!" and offered
me a seat at a table. How could I say no? The three of us all sat.

We had a nice talk over dinner. He asked questions and seemed genuinely
interested in what I did -- work, family. But the highlight was toward the end.

**Rob Reiner**: What else can I answer for you?

**Sef**: What would you tell someone early in their career?

At this point I was about thirty years old, so hardly _that_ early in my own
career, but I was asking in a genuine way. He answered straight away.

**Rob Reiner**: <mark>Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every
day.</mark> Me, I like writing so I try to do that of it every day if I can. 
That's how you get good.

then told a few stories about he meets people who don't do this. I guess when
you're someone like him people asking you frequently for jobs or if you'd
produce their movie or whatnot. He said that he'd ask them what was the last
thing they'd written, or what they were working on now, or what'd they'd written
today. And he could tell if they did it often and did it for fun. If it was a
chore and a burden that was a bad sign.

(BTW, I've used this when hiring people who are even the least bit technical,
even managers. I ask them to write some code, even just a little bit. Do they
relish or dread it? Does it seem like they've done it recently? You can tell a
lot from how they react, which is more important than the answer itself.)

I was struck by what a nice and interesting, and interested, person Rob Reiner
was. It was incredibly generous for him to spend time with a fanboy when he
could be off duty and just enjoying his cheeseburger. What a gem.
