* Get really good at the hard games

    * Bridge
    * Go
    * Poker

* Read Fiction

    * All that sci-fi that your: Verner Vinge, Iain Banks, Michael Moorcock
    * Tackle the Baroque Cycle again
    * Even fun stuff like Agatha Christie mysteries

* Read Non-Fiction

    * History: Napoleon, Rome, Byzantium, ancient India
    * Science: Nuclear energy
    * Biography: Marie Curie 
    * Business: Hard Things 

* Actually write an iOS app. Maybe even a watch app now that I have one.

* Automate my home

    * Get metrics from everything that can be measured, like my car ([Automatic][a]), my [NAS][nas], etc.
    * Redo my whole home media setup with something like [Plex][]
    * Build a whole new personal email stack

* Redo my site and resume as modern beautiful web content. Stick to static pages, but try to do even more client-side.

* Play with arbitrary technology with no specific goal in mind

    * Raspberry Pi

* Pick up some bigger features on [Midas][]

* Get good at leisure

    * Play video games -- I'm only 25% of the way through Skyrim, and I'm sure there's better stuff than that
    * Watch a ton of baseball -- if only I was still in Boston
