So you're looking for a mentor, that's great! It's something that's
helped me a lot in career, and I'm sure it'll be valuable for you
both. This post is about how to find a good mentor, ask them, and
then keep that relationship positive.

### Choosing

These three rules have held true across many companies and many years.

1\. Your mentor should be **someone you admire**. The best choice
is usually someone the same career path as you, but further along
by some years. They don't have to be super far along, it could just
be the next step, but they've shown that they're willing and able
to take on more responsibility and have bigger roles. Or maybe
they're just someone super interesting and inspirational.

This is easiest to judge in a big company, where the levels and
roles are usually written up and assigned to everyone.  In a small
company it can be the person who is a leader, even if they don't
have the title.

Another way this cane come about is if you're thinking about making
a change -- from Engineer to Eng Manager, or Eng Manager to Product
Manager, say. Then it's not so much about further along the path,
as finding someone who has made the switch. Often they're the most
eager to talk about how they did it.

2\. They can be organizationally close by, but **not one of your
leaders**. I've gotten the most out of mentors outside my chain of
command. That way, I never had to worry about choosing my words (or
topics) carefully. I could problem solve or just vent. Sometimes
the person you need to sort out is your [own
boss](/posts/problem-or-solution-boss). Sorting that out can be a
lot easier if the person you're working with doesn't have a stake
in the outcome, or word might get back to the person you're discussing.

3\. **Rapport** is super important. Your meetings can't feel like
a chore for either of you. Even if you've gotten along fine in the
past, maybe you'll hit it off in this new relationship, maybe now.

A lot of big companies have formal mentoring programs that help
with matchmaking, and that can be a great way to do it. If you don't
have someone natural in mind, try that.

### Asking

You'll be the one getting most of the value out of this relationship.
So when you ask, ask nicely. Understand that they're likely busy
and make sure they know it's OK to say no.

I've always asked for a trial run first. Let's to three or four
meetings and then re-evaluate. That way you can make sure that it's
clicking -- the "rapport" criteria above. If it's not feeling great
_on both sides_ then stop them and go with someone else, no harm
no foul.

### Being A Good Mentee

So you've found someone, great. To make it through probation and
onward, these are the things you should do.

1\. **Respect their time**. Be prompt. Ask them what kinds of
meetings work best for them (30 min? over a meal?) and work around
their schedule.

2\. **Come prepared** with a topic or two, keep a backlog. It can
be something specific, like problem solving a particular situation
or relationship. Or it could be getting just-in-time feedback on a
proposed email or document. Or it could be open-ended, e.g. if you
could advise your former self 10 years ago, what would you have
said?

3\. **Check in** from time to time. Make sure this is still working
out for them: the style of meeting, duration, etc.

4\. Find an appropriate way to **thank them**. Nothing big but it's
important to show that you appreciate their time. For example at
my current employer (Google) we have a little system to give
shout-outs to peers that usually come up during performance review
time.

If you're like me and you've been working for a long time, find a
way to **pay it forward**. Introduce mentors and mentees; volunteer
in your company's matchmaking service; find people who appear to
stranded and offer to help them out. Sending them this post is a fine
icebreaker.
