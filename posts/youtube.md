I'm excited to start my new job at YouTube in a few weeks. I'll manage the
engineering team building the data warehouse for usage metrics.

I like that YouTube is **important**, as seen in their [statistics][s].
You don't see usage like that without a bunch of **hard problems**, and
hard problems attract **bright people**. Indeed that's the clincher for
why I'm looking forward to working there. People vote with their feet, and
I have a lot of friends who have opted for Google, and YouTube
specifically. They tell me that it's a great place to work.

YouTube is one of the worlds foremost platforms for social commentary,
education, and free speech. And it's plenty of [entertainment][e] too. Sounds
like fun.
