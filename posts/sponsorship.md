Sponsorship is about advocacy. A sponsor uses their position and influence
(candidly, their _power_) to help someone get ahead. Or, if you're on the
receiving end of this, you're asking someone powerful to speak up for you when
and where it matters.

Sponsorship is distinct from [Mentorship](/posts/mentoring) in that it's not
nearly the same level of involvement. There's not an expectation that you'll
work through problems together or build a relationship that lasts a while. But
you are asking a sponsor for their time to engage with you and your work. More
importantly, you're asking them to put their reputation on the line for you,
even if just a little bit, by being your advocate.

Does asking for sponsorship feel a little unseemly? I admit it used to feel that
way to me, like grubbing for grades or "being political." Now I see it as being
thoughtful about how decisions are actually made.

In some ways, sponsorship acknowledges and even co-opts the "you have to know
somebody" way that things usually work. Underrepresented groups can use
sponsorship to wedge into that system. And if you're in a traditionally dominant
group, consider sponsoring people who aren't like you.

[Carla Harris][] gave a talk at Google in 2022 on sponsorship that made an
impression on me. (Here's a [2019 TED Talk][vid] that hits a lot of the same
points.) Her own candid way of talking about this helped me consider it much
more myself, and think of ways that it might be useful to others.

### Maybe You're Going Up For Promotion

With this in mind, let's apply this to promotions.

Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias these decisions, they are complicated
and are made by real-world humans. Organizations look to their senior people to
bring their experience, knowledge, and judgment to bear.

Consider how the promotion decision will be made for your case. One key question
is **who'll be in the room**? This isn't just who is invited and who will
attend, but more who will be **influential** in the discussion and decision
making process, and **for what** kinds of questions. Not everyone has an equal
voice.

Say you're an engineer going up for promotion to senior engineer. Then likely a senior
tech lead (not necessarily _your_ tech lead!) will be asked to speak to the
quality of your work (e.g. good code, considered alternatives, future-proofing).
A senior manager will likely be asked to assess how well you worked with others
and made good decisions. And these are just two of the factors &mdash; there
will be many others depending on your role and level. You need to work down the
rubric and think through all the levers.

Sometimes you might know who the key person will be but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.

And then assess their level of support. This may be something you can do
yourself (if you have a relationship already) or maybe you'll need your
manager's help. But somehow you need to ask them, as candidly as you can, "If
asked about X, what will you say?" It can sometimes be hard to get an honest
answer, so you may need to push a little. Reassure them you'd much rather know
now if you have their support or not and you're not going to hold it against
them.

If you don't have their support yet, that's OK. Think about work you can do
to change that over time.

### Day-To-Day Decisions

Not all decisions are as high-stakes as promotions. Leaders make decisions all
the time, like whom to trust to lead a project or run a meeting. I like to think
about these small-but-important decisions too in the context of sponsorship. Is
your manager your sponsor? What about your TL?
