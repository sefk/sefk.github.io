Sponsorship is about advocacy. A sponsor uses their position and influence
(candidly, their _power_) to help someone get ahead. Or, if you're on the
receiving end of this, you're asking someone powerful to speak up for you when
and where it matters.

Sponsorship is distinct from [Mentorship](/posts/mentoring) in that it's much
less engaged. You're not working through problems together or even forming a
deep and meaningful relationship. A sponsor is more of an advocate. They can
even be a point-in-time advocate, just for some particular upcoming decision.

Having somoene be your sponsor sounds a little unseemly, no? I admit it can feel
like grubbing for grades or "being political." I used to think so myself, but
I've come around. Now I see it as being thoughtful about how decisions are
actually made.

[Carla Harris](https://www.carlaspearls.com/) writes and speaks about this.
She gave a talk at Google in 2022 that made an impression on me. (Here's a [2019 TED
Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE_W50OTUc) that hits a lot of the same
points.) Her own candid way of talking made me consider it much more actively
and talk about it more openly.

### So You're Going Up For Promotion

With this in mind, let me address this section to people going up for promotion.

Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias, it's a hard decisions that needs to
be made by real humans. So we have to look to our senior people to bring their
experience and knowledge and judgment to bear.

With that in mind, consider how your own promotion decision will be made.
Consider **who is in the room**. This isn't just the attendees of the meeting,
but more who will be **influential** and for what. Not everyone has has equal
voice. Say you're a an engineer going up for promotion to Senior. Then likely a
Tech Lead will be asked to speak to the quality of your work (e.g. good code,
considered alternatives, futureproofing); a senior manager will likely be asked
to assess your process and teamwork. These are just a couple of factors, in
reality there's a lot that'll be considered. You need to work down the rubric
and think through all the levers.

Sometimes you might know who the key person will be but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.

And then as you identify those key people, assess their level of support. This
may be something you can do yourself if you have a relationship with them
already, or maybe you'll need manager help. But somehow you need to ask them, as
candidly as you can, "if asked what will you say?" It can sometimes be hard to get an honest answer,
so you (or your manager) may need to push a little and be very reassuring. You'd rather know
now if you don't have their support, and you're not going to hold it against
them.

Even if they won't be your sponsor, your advocate in the room, do what you can to at least
now you know if they'll abstain or even be a critic.
