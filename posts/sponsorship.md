Sponsorship is using one's position and influence to help someone get ahead.
It's similar in many ways to mentorship which I [wrote about](/posts/mentoring)
last year. But sponsorship is a bit tricker. Most people understand mentorship
and have default feelings about it. Sponsorship is at best a bit less famiiar,
but maybe even can feel a bit unseemly.

I got turned onto this by a talk [Carla Harris][] gave at Google in 2022 &mdash;
her [2019 TED Talk][vid] hits a lot of the same points. She spoke about the
value of sponsorship in her career and how rewarding it's been to seek out and
sponsor others. More than just the description, what I most appreciated was her
candor. It gave me a permission structure consider sponsorship more openly. I
started using the word and concept more frequently with people that I work with
and to consider sponsors (or lack of sponsors) when debugging how a decision
played out. It's not a new concept, but it used to feel to me like
grade-grubbing or "being political," now I see it as being thoughtful about how
decisions are actually made.

Sponsorship is similar to mentoring in that it is about investing in someone,
but the mechanism is very different. Mentoring involves time together teaching
and problem solving. Sponsoring takes some time too to understand their
goals and strengths. But the real investment is the sponsor _putting
their reputation on the line_ to help someone more junior achieve their goals.
Some examples are vouching for someone during a staffing conversations, or
actively putting their name forward when an opportunity comes up.

In some ways, sponsorship acknowledges and even co-opts the "you have to know
somebody" way that things actually work. Underrepresented groups can benefit
from sponsorship as a way to wedge into existing power structures. If that
describes you, consider asking for someone to explicitly sponsor you; if you're
in a traditionally priveleged group, consider sponsoring someone who isn't so
much.

While reviewing piece, my Google peer [Rachel][] pointed me to a great phrase
that captures this nicely: "women are often over-mentored and under-sponsored."

### Maybe You're Going Up For Promotion

With this in mind, let's apply this to promotions.

Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias these decisions, they are complicated
and are made by real-world humans. Organizations look to their senior people to
bring their experience, knowledge, and judgment to bear.

Consider how the promotion decision will be made for your case. One key question
is **who'll be in the room**? This isn't just who is invited and who will
attend, but more who will be **influential** in the discussion and decision
making process, and **for what** kinds of questions. Not everyone has an equal
voice.

Say you're an engineer going up for promotion to senior engineer. Then likely a senior
tech lead (not necessarily _your_ tech lead!) will be asked to speak to the
quality of your work (e.g. good code, considered alternatives, future-proofing).
A senior manager will likely be asked to assess how well you worked with others
and made good decisions. And these are just two of the factors &mdash; there
will be many others depending on your role and level. You need to work down the
rubric and think through all the levers.

Sometimes you might know who the key person will be but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.

And then assess their level of support. This may be something you can do
yourself (if you have a relationship already) or maybe you'll need your
manager's help. But somehow you need to ask them, as candidly as you can, "If
asked about X, what will you say?" It can sometimes be hard to get an honest
answer, so you may need to push a little. Reassure them you'd much rather know
now if you have their support or not and you're not going to hold it against
them.

If you don't have their support yet, that's OK. Think about work you can do
to change that over time.

### Day-To-Day Decisions

Not all decisions are as high-stakes as promotions. Leaders make decisions all
the time, like whom to trust to lead a project or run a meeting. I like to think
about these small-but-important decisions too in the context of sponsorship. Is
your manager your sponsor? What about your TL?
