For the past five years I've gathered statistics on how many
trick-or-treaters have come by on Halloween.  If you want to read
about that, check out posts from [last year][] or [the year before][].
This post is about **how** I track those stats, and how I
don't.

Every year I'm tempted to build some fancy system to collect
and manage these statistics.  Wouldn't it be fun, say, to wire up
some Raspberry Pi sensor that automatically counts and tweets 
running totals?  It wouldn't be *that* hard and sounds like fun.

The problem is reliability.  It's just so hard to beat a clipboard,
paper, and a ball point pen, things that never fail.  Even if I did
build something fancy, the data is so precious to me that I'd still
end up doing the tallies by hand.  It's sad to say, but the tech
ends up being net negative.

It reminds me of a story told to me once by my friend [Tony Cannon].
Tony and his brother [Tom] run an giant gaming convention every
year, [Evolution Championship Series][evo] (Evo for short).  It's
a multi-day convention in Las Vegas that attracts something like
ten thousand participants.  They run the whole thing with their two
other founders and some friends &mdash; I'm sure they have some
paid help now, but the four guys are the main ones.  It's impressive.

Tony told me once that they've tried to get more high-tech at various
points with the event.  It's easy to see why that'd be tempting:
they have multiple mobile coordinators that need access to changing,
shared information, like brackets and schedules.  But whatll they've
tried has let them down.  Usually it's not the hard parts that fail,
but the basics, like batteries and wireless connectivity.  So they
still run this off of printouts and voice communications (cell
phones/walkie-talkies) and periodic data dumps.

And so, this year, like every other year, I'll be gathering my
Halloween stats like I always have: clipboard, pen, and a hand-held
[tally counter][].  As usual, the data will still be timely and
accurate.

For those of you curious, my 
[Halloween Traffic Spreadsheet][sheet] is public, check it out!

Two postscripts.  First, I hate it whenever I hear people make this same
point using the famous [NASA Space Pen story][ww].  You've probably
heard it: that Americans over-engineered the solution to writing
in space by commissioning a multi-million dollar space pen project,
while those scrappy can-do Russians just used pencils instead.
Well, this story has been [debunked by the good people at Snopes][debunk]
and NASA's reputation is in good stead.  So stop spreading that
story!

And second, I'd like to plug Tony and Tom "day job", [Stonehearth][].
I think of it as Starcraft meets Minecraft.  I am so eager to play
it when it lands.
