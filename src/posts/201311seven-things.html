I liked <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/511/the-seven-things-youre-not-supposed-to-talk-about">this week's episode of This American Life</a>. The idea is there are seven topics that you should avoid in conversation because they are always boring. <strong>I like this list! </strong>

<p>
Here is the <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/511/transcript">transcript</a>.  I repeat the list here.

<p>
<ol>
	<li>How you <strong>slept</strong>.</li>
	<li>Your <strong>period</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Health</strong>. Of course if it's something serious, then that's conversation worthy, but normal sniffles, aches, and pains? No good.</li>
	<li>Your <strong>dreams</strong>.  Not big aspirations, this is literally what you dreamt last night</li>
	<li><strong>Money</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Diet</strong>. What you can and can't eat.</li>
	<li><strong>Route</strong>. How you got here, what way you're going to get home.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I will endeavor to not waste all of your time droning on about any of these topics.
