<img class="alignright  wp-image-454" style="border: 0px;" alt="airmail" src="/f/airmail.png" width="179" height="179">Finally a thick-client email program that seems to have stuck. So far I am really liking <a href="http://airmailapp.com/">Airmail</a>.

<p>
For years I've flipped between various Mac fat clients and the GMail web interface. The web interface keeps winning:

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Outstanding search</li>
	<li>Great keyboard shortcuts (go Vi!)</li>
	<li>Very good use of screen real estate</li>
</ul>

<p>
But the killer is the reliance on a rock-solid Internet connection, and GMail's own slowdowns. Even though there is an offline mode, it is such a downgrade it's not worth using. So if you need to use offline you're in bad shape; same if you're on a slow or lossy connection, or if GMail is having a bad day.  Sadly, that's pretty often these days.



<p>
Airmail is cheap (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmail/id573171375?mt=12">$1.99 in the App Store</a>) and super featureful. It coexists well with GMail's paradigm (archive vs. delete, threading includes sent items, drafts). Great configuration options. Visually pleasing. Robust.



<p>
There are really only three places where it has fallen short for me:

<p>
<ul>
	<li>I miss GMail's tabs. Those are still the best way to filter mail, and I was impressed with how well that feature worked and quickly became natural.</li>
	<li>Search. Airmail's isn't bad, but nothing is as good at this as Google's own.</li>
	<li>Gmail (with Chrome) has a great feature where you can drop in a picture and it is resized to look good.  Lacking that I now have to manually resize my giant retina-display screenshots.</li>
</ul>

So-long to <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#mail">Mail.app</a> and <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/">Mailplane</a>. Or until someone does really nails <a href="https://www.mailpile.is/">self-hosting</a>.</body></html>
