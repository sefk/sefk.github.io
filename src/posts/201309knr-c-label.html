Today in a box I came across my old K&amp;R. Probably the most valuable book I've owned. My copy has been heavily used.</p>

<p>
But the unexpected, fun thing was finding an old label on the back cover.



<p>
There is a lot in there.

<ul>
	<li>January 1994. I had just graduated college, driven cross country with my friend <a href="www.linkedin.com/pub/shigeru-tanaka/0/a27/917">Shig</a>, and started my first post-college job. I would have been in that job four months or so and realized that I should just stop borrowing someone else's copy (probably <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/larryclaman/">Larry Claman</a>'s) and buy my own.</li>
	<li>Purchased at Quantum Books, a great technical bookstore in the shadow of MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It's no longer there. The bar that is there now (<a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.themeadhall.com/">Meadhall</a>) is a nice place, and I'm a big fan of beer, but it's not the same.</li>
	<li>According to an <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">inflation calculator</a>, $35 in 1994 is $55 today. That's expensive for a little book, especially to the twenty-two year old me.</li>
	<li>Note the email address: quanbook@world.std.com. This was back when mom and pop dialup ISP's where what we all used, people and businesses alike. This particular one, <a style="font-style: normal;" href="http://world.std.com/">Software Tool &amp; Die</a>, was my private email address at the time too. (Aside: they claim to be the first public dialup ISP, and I have no reason to doubt them)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It was fun being reminded of all this stuff. So the lesson of the story: it's still worth buying books, and when you do, don't remove the labels.</body></html>
