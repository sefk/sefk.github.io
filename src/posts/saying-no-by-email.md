When I have to tell someone no, I pick up the phone. And I **hate** talking on the phone, but I do it anyway.

When you're answering no to something, you're disappointing them, even if just a little bit. So you owe it to them to talk to them instead of sending an email. It's the polite thing to do. But there are two other reasons, albeit selfish ones. First, the call gives you immediate feedback on how they took the news. If they're upset then you can do damage control right then; at least you know! And second, delivering bad news directly and respectfully is an important skill to develop. We can all use the practice. Andi it's never as bad as I think its going to be.
