I often wake up with a song going through my head. I don't know
why this happens. The stranger thing the songs. Yesterday
was good, I woke up to Led Zepplin's [Immigrant Song][led] &mdash;
what a great way to start the day. But earlier in the week it was
inexplicably the [Golden Girls Theme Song][gold]. Gah!

I've heard them called earworms: songs that get stuck in your head and
don't get out. So I'll share with you now the antidote, taught to
me by my good friend [Jane Manning][jane].  Thanks, Jane!

**Sing David Bowie's song [John, I'm Only Dancing][bowie].**
Not one of Bowie's better known songs, nor even one of his best, but
remarkably well suited to this. I believe it's because the
melody is kind of odd and not all that pleasant, so it's not going
to get stuck itself. You kind of remember the melody and lyrics,
but not quite, so that keeps you busy. It always does the trick.
