This year's Halloween tally was 208.  I don't know why we have 32%
fewer trick-or-treaters than we had last year, which was down 20%
from the year before that.  Maybe the rain earlier in the day kept
people home.  Maybe because it was Friday people opted for parties
instead of going door to door.  I don't know.
