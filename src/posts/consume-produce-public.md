One of my goals for this year is to try to produce more and consume
less. Not in the green, fixed-planetary-resources sense \[1\]. I
mean to make more things, ideas, contributions.  To be more creative.
Creative in literal sense of that word: creating.

[Rands][r] said it well in his post this week, 
["The Builder's High'][bh]. If you haven't read it, go do so now.
I'll wait.  (and while you're at it, if you don't have him followed
or bookmarked or whatever, do that too.)

I agree with pretty much everything he said in there. The good
feeling that comes from actually making soemthing. How that's
especially true now in light of the constant crush of everyone
else's creations (he called them "moments"). 

Making takes many forms. Since I stink at woodworking and gardening
and painting, I'll stick to the things I do enjoy, like writing and
coding and cooking. Those fit less into the traditional mold of
"building" or "making" but that's OK.

I want to take it one step further. Here are my three categories
in value order. Numbers 1 and 2 we just spoke of, but 3 is new.

1. **Consume**. This is watching TV, playing video games, trashy
   reading. Sure I'm going to keep doing that, but it's not energizing.

2. **Produce**. Cooking a meal, learning something interesting. Maybe
   even reading something intellectually challenging, but that's pushing
   it.

3. **Produce, In Public**. Now, this is the toughie. It's one thing to 
   do something creative, another to put yourself out there and tell 
   poeple what you did, and why. By sharing the product, by talking
   people through the choices you made to get there, you're opening
   yourself up to criticism. But why not!

That is part of the reason why I [reworked my blog][nikola] over the
holiday break, so I'd have a nicer platform for writing. Anything to
lower the bar to produce.

[1] I'm not anti-green. I really appreciate the environmental
warriors out there who walk the walk with real life choices to
consume less. That's just not my bailiwick, for now at least.
