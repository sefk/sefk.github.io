Three days ago I was hobbling around on a sore knee with a torn
meniscus. But after just three days of icing and Ibuprofen and
resting on the couch already my knee is almost better than it was
before. This arthroscopic surgery stuff is amazing.

My knee had been getting progressively worse for the past few months.
But the clincher was six weeks ago, when I was chasing around a dog that
was loose in our front yard. A twist, pop, and I was down. The doctor
I saw the next day confirmed that it wasn't anything "serious" like a
torn ligament, but something was definitely wrong. When we went up to
a week of family camping a few weeks back, I couldn't go on any hikes
and could barely play ping pong. It was a real bummer.

So I met with a sports medicine doctor at Palo Alto Medical Foundation
and got an MRI. He saw a few things wrong in there. A few days later, I
was getting the procedure done. Viola. 

Afterwards I was surprised that it didn't hurt. They did prescribe
some pain medication (Hydrocodone plus Acetaminophen) that I've
been taking when I go to bed, but haven't needed during the day.
I've been using a [machine that pumps ice water through a pad][ice]
around my knee all day to keep it cool, and that's worked really
well. **So much better** than ice packs. Totally recommend the ice
machine.

Thanks to the good surgical team at [Palo Alto Medical Foundation][pamf]
especially [Dr. Colin Eakin][eakin]. Their surgery center on Willow Road
made the whole experience smooth and reassuring. 

But one pro tip for you out there considering this. Don't read the
[wikipedia article on General Anesthesia][gen] the night before
surgery. It's crazy stuff. Especially the parts about how we're
still not really sure how it works, or the part about how the level
of anesthesia where it is safe to operate is right between "excitement"
where you vomit and twitch, and "overdose" where you stop breathing.
Don't read that part.

I'm back to work tomorrow, and I expect to be back on my bike by next
week!
