I wrote my first computer program when I was twelve years old on
an Apple //e. It was a simple [robots game][] handwritten 6502
assembly. It took all summer to write. That's when I caught the
programming bug and I've still got it. Still it's a fun day when I
get to write some code.

At some point I wanted to have an impact beyond just my own two
hands so I became an engineering manager. I went from line managing
engineers (fun) to managing managers (harder) to being VP Engineering
and/or Operations (less fun). While I can do the bigger job, I've
been tending to do more hands-on work lately. 

I used to be more of a backend guy -- distributed systems, scalability,
operations, things like that. As I've gotten further along I've
moved further and further up the stack and lately have been spending
more time with client frameworks and mobile. Those spaces are
technically intersting now and you can have a big impact you can
*see*. And there is so much [great][s3] [backend][sqs] [stuff][heroku]
that you can just *buy* now! But that doesn't mean that I don't
like getting my hands into ops. In particular I've spent a fair bit
of time in the Amazon Web Services stack and know my way around
there pretty well.

In additional to techie things I'm a father of two great girls and
really enjoy cards and board games. I'm on the Board of Directors
at [Peninsula School][].

information about why I chose Nikola, and how that works, I wrote
a [blog post][static] about that in Dec 2013.

to serve HTTPS on a vanity domain from their service, but when that
comes, I'll gladly switch to that!
