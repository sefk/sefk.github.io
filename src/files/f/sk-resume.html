<b>I am a hands-on engineering/operations leader</b> who builds
meaningful and interesting Internet software.
I have experience with distributed systems of thousands of servers,
or a single site.
I'm working on being a full-stack engineer by writing code
<a href="http://github.com/sefk">nearly every day</a>.
I write Python for fun.
I've led core engineering and ops groups at Akamai, VMware, Ning,
and now Stanford.
Although I've managed 140 engineers across three locations, I prefer
small teams who move fast.
Last summer I lead a team that built and launched an
<a href="http://class2go.stanford.edu/">open-source MOOC platform</a>
in eleven weeks.
One of my
<a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/2012/05/engineering-culture-litmus-tests/">blog posts</a>
hit the top spot of Hacker News.
BS Computer Science, Stanford 1993.
