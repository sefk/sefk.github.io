# sef.kloninger.com AKA sefk.github.io 

This is my personal blog.  It is a Nikola static site hosted by Github
pages.  This repo contains both the source files, in the ```src```
subdirectory, as well as the resulting product itself, in the top level
directory.


# Instructions

The general workflow is:

1. **Write**.  Use livereload to watch the right directories and reload
   when necessary (nice workflow!):

        cd src
        livereload -b ..

2. **Publish**.  Check the whole thing into Github.  The ```src```
   subdirectory has the markdown and the top directory has the generated
   static site.

3. **Repeat**
