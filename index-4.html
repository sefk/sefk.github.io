<p>Three days ago I was hobbling around on a sore knee with a torn
meniscus. But after just three days of icing and Ibuprofen and
resting on the couch already my knee is almost better than it was
before. This arthroscopic surgery stuff is amazing.</p>
<p>My knee had been getting progressively worse for the past few months.
But the clincher was six weeks ago, when I was chasing around a dog that
was loose in our front yard. A twist, pop, and I was down. The doctor
I saw the next day confirmed that it wasn't anything "serious" like a
torn ligament, but something was definitely wrong. When we went up to
a week of family camping a few weeks back, I couldn't go on any hikes
and could barely play ping pong. It was a real bummer.</p>
<p>So I met with a sports medicine doctor at Palo Alto Medical Foundation
and got an MRI. He saw a few things wrong in there. A few days later, I
was getting the procedure done. Viola. </p>
<p>Afterwards I was surprised that it didn't hurt. They did prescribe
some pain medication (Hydrocodone plus Acetaminophen) that I've
been taking when I go to bed, but haven't needed during the day.
I've been using a <a href="http://www.djoglobal.com/products/donjoy/donjoy-iceman-clear3">machine that pumps ice water through a pad</a>
around my knee all day to keep it cool, and that's worked really
well. <strong>So much better</strong> than ice packs. Totally recommend the ice
machine.</p>
<p>Thanks to the good surgical team at <a href="http://www.pamf.org/sports/">Palo Alto Medical Foundation</a>
especially <a href="http://www.pamf.org/dr-colin-l-eakin.html">Dr. Colin Eakin</a>. Their surgery center on Willow Road
made the whole experience smooth and reassuring. </p>
<p>But one pro tip for you out there considering this. Don't read the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthesia">wikipedia article on General Anesthesia</a> the night before
surgery. It's crazy stuff. Especially the parts about how we're
still not really sure how it works, or the part about how the level
of anesthesia where it is safe to operate is right between "excitement"
where you vomit and twitch, and "overdose" where you stop breathing.
Don't read that part.</p>
<p>I'm back to work tomorrow, and I expect to be back on my bike by next
week!</p>

<p>I often wake up with a song going through my head. I don't know
why this happens. The stranger thing the songs. Yesterday
was good, I woke up to Led Zepplin's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjlJBmwF3PI">Immigrant Song</a> —
what a great way to start the day. But earlier in the week it was
inexplicably the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiQzUEc_FmI">Golden Girls Theme Song</a>. Gah!</p>
<p>I've heard them called earworms: songs that get stuck in your head and
don't get out. So I'll share with you now the antidote, taught to
me by my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jinpa1345">Jane Manning</a>.  Thanks, Jane!</p>
<p><strong>Sing David Bowie's song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VrqCBsbeuc">John, I'm Only Dancing</a>.</strong>
Not one of Bowie's better known songs, nor even one of his best, but
remarkably well suited to this. I believe it's because the
melody is kind of odd and not all that pleasant, so it's not going
to get stuck itself. You kind of remember the melody and lyrics,
but not quite, so that keeps you busy. It always does the trick. </p>

<p>I really don't like tipping. I'm not like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-qV9wVGb38">Mr. Pink</a>. It's
not that I don't want my server or driver to get something extra.
I just don't like the awkward social situation of deciding if this
is a tipping situation, and if so, how much.</p>
<p>Two services have come up recently where I will happily pay a premium
to not have to fret about too much or too little:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Uber</strong>. Lots to like about this service but the act of just 
  leaving out of my cab without paying is joyful. I always rate 
  my drivers, good or bad. 98% of the time, it's good by the way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>OrderAhead</strong>. Are you supposed to tip when picking up takeout 
  from a restaurant? I've never known. Neither way feels right, so 
  I usually end up splitting the difference and rounding up to 
  some amount, say leaving a 6% tip, which is the <em>worst</em> choice. 
  Either that's 6% that wasn't expected, or I'm inadvertently
  shafting someone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these services decouple feedback from money. Both avoid
awkwardly changing money. I'd definitely pay a premium for that.</p>
<p>I wonder what other service business would benefit from decoupling
feedback from money?</p>

<p>If I could do my college years over I would focus on writing. I
would take courses that required a lot of writing, in the spirit
of "learn by doing". I'd also take courses in the mechanics and
craft: grammar, vocabulary, and rhetoric.</p>
<p>I used to consider myself a competent writer. And certainly good
enough for an engineer, right? But I've learned that I have a long
way to go. I've learned that engineers spend much more time writing
than you expect. And I appreciate how hard it is to write well.</p>
<p>This came up just this past week. I came across a beautiful four
page essay. It laid out the problem, described alternatives, and
lead you concisely to a well-reasoned conclusion. Sure, it was about
technology, but what carried the day was the good writing. Humbling!</p>
<p>You're saying: but wait, you're a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-Haired_Boss">pointy-haired boss</a> now
Sef, one of those guys who doesn't do <em>Real Work</em> anymore. You write
email and boss people around. I understand why managers like you
need to write, I'm an engineer. I write code. Well, there's some
truth to that. But I'd like to convince you that even monster coders,
if they're any good, write a lot, write well, and value good writing
in others.</p>
<p>It is rare for someone to do their work in isolation and have it
matter. Either you're working as part of a team, in a company or
a community of developers, say on an open-source project. Sure, you
build a great system or feature. But to have it matter to the world,
for others to adopt it, you need to document, publicize, support,
teach. 98% of that is writing.</p>
<p>I had a lunchtime conversation with <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>,
Django's co-founder, at last year's PyCon. I asked him why Django
caught on and was adopted by so many of us (including <a href="http://class2go.stanford.edu/">my last
project</a> and <a href="http://code.edx.org/">my current project</a>). I was expecting him
to point to features or timing. Instead he said it was "because we
wrote good docs". The Django team didn't treat documentation as an
afterthought. They have lots of docs, and they are good.</p>
<p>Consider that rare bird, the iconoclastic engineer working in
isolation on their own project. I'm thinking of <a href="http://antirez.com/">Antirez</a> or
<a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco</a>. (Maybe they aren't even truly on their own so much.
Humor me!) They are prolific and strong coders. But they also write
a lot of words! They write a ton about their project; also tech
landscape and their place in it. Would their software have as much
of an impact if they didn't write so much (and well)? I say no.</p>
<p>Case in point. Both Marco and I wrote blog posts riffing off the
same topic two weeks ago. First, read <a href="http://sef.kloninger.com/posts/consume-produce-public.html">mine</a>, then
<a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/01/03/the-builders-high">his</a>.  It takes me a ton of words to get something
basic out.  His is concise and clear. Sheesh.</p>
<p>So kids, don't shortchange those liberal arts classes. It's not
fluffy stuff on the side. <strong>That is core</strong>. You need to write well
to be a good engineer.</p>
<p>Protip: the best way to do this is to major in the humanities. They
write like crazy over there. Be like my friend Dan Chu and major
in history, but secretly take CS courses on the side. If you're
super smart like him, and can manage getting both degrees, then
you're awesome. But don't sacrifice the BA for the BS. I would
<strong>love</strong> to talk to a candidate with with a History BA and a Computer
Science MS.</p>

<p>My family hasn't avoided the colds that are going around now. My
way of fighting back is making chicken noodle soup.  It's not too
hard, it's satisfying, and it tastes great. <a href="f/chicken_soup.pdf">The recipe</a> belongs
to <a href="http://peninsulaschool.org/">Peninsula School</a> and gets used at our annual Craft Fair.
It's benefited from years of refinement.</p>
<p>I add more salt. I don't do peas. I've tried with rice but it
got starchy and weird, stick with egg noodles.</p>

<p>One of my goals for this year is to try to produce more and consume
less. Not in the green, fixed-planetary-resources sense [1]. I
mean to make more things, ideas, contributions.  To be more creative.
Creative in literal sense of that word: creating.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rands">Rands</a> said it well in his post this week, 
<a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/">"The Builder's High'</a>. If you haven't read it, go do so now.
I'll wait.  (and while you're at it, if you don't have him followed
or bookmarked or whatever, do that too.)</p>
<p>I agree with pretty much everything he said in there. The good
feeling that comes from actually making soemthing. How that's
especially true now in light of the constant crush of everyone
else's creations (he called them "moments"). </p>
<p>Making takes many forms. Since I stink at woodworking and gardening
and painting, I'll stick to the things I do enjoy, like writing and
coding and cooking. Those fit less into the traditional mold of
"building" or "making" but that's OK.</p>
<p>I want to take it one step further. Here are my three categories
in value order. Numbers 1 and 2 we just spoke of, but 3 is new.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Consume</strong>. This is watching TV, playing video games, trashy
   reading. Sure I'm going to keep doing that, but it's not energizing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Produce</strong>. Cooking a meal, learning something interesting. Maybe
   even reading something intellectually challenging, but that's pushing
   it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Produce, In Public</strong>. Now, this is the toughie. It's one thing to 
   do something creative, another to put yourself out there and tell 
   poeple what you did, and why. By sharing the product, by talking
   people through the choices you made to get there, you're opening
   yourself up to criticism. But why not!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is part of the reason why I <a href="posts/switching-to-static.html">reworked my blog</a> over the
holiday break, so I'd have a nicer platform for writing. Anything to
lower the bar to produce.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] I'm not anti-green. I really appreciate the environmental
warriors out there who walk the walk with real life choices to
consume less. That's just not my bailiwick, for now at least.</p>
