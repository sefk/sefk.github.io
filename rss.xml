&lt;p&gt;Governments should produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"&gt;public goods&lt;/a&gt;, like navigation aids, roads, and
water treatment infrastructure. That seems like a reasonable thing to expect of
a functioning government, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to &lt;strong&gt;remove data&lt;/strong&gt;. All through 2025, websites
were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; tells
catalogs what's been happening; this report by the &lt;a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century"&gt;American Statistical
Association&lt;/a&gt; tells the whole story and implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response the &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/"&gt;Data Rescue Project&lt;/a&gt; sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/"&gt;project's press page&lt;/a&gt; has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers. I was
eager to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on,
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIFLD is a collection of maps. Basic stuff: roads, levees, river depth charts,
locations of military bases. Beyond just being good, generally accessible maps,
a big part of its value is when everyone uses &lt;em&gt;the same maps&lt;/em&gt;. HIFLD is mostly
curating data. Most of the data comes from other (USGS, Army Corps of Engineers,
Census Bureau) that HIFLD brings together and provides it in a trustworthy,
central place. Well, I should say "provided" because in September the
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/"&gt;government stopped providing it&lt;/a&gt;. The story is well told in this &lt;a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.
It's a good read so I don't have to report it all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers scooped up the
data into temporary storage and organized a bucket brigade of volunteers to put
&lt;a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open"&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt; into long-term storage. Importantly, this was coupled with metadata
to ensure they're findable later. That's the part I worked on, uploading and
entering metadata. &lt;a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524"&gt;Frank Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;, the project manager, wrote up a nice
&lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of what we did. I used a nice Selenium driver, written by another
volunteer, to create over a hundred projects (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs"&gt;screen recording&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt; to see
the breadth of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm proud of the work, and very supportive, I keep in mind that this i
still playing defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having
the government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding the
government does better! Assert your rights and &lt;a href="https://www.nokings.org/"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt; ❌ 👑.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Civics</category><category>Life</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/data-preservation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rob Reiner: "Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every day."</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/rob-reiner/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/rob-reiner.jpg" alt="Photo of Rob Reiner from Wikipedia, source Neil Grabowsky / Montclair Film Festival" width="30%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have met and shared a meal with Rob Reiner some years back. I
wanted to take a moment to share this story on the sad occasion of his death
this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 2003 or so. I lived and worked for Akamai in Boston. I had been going
back and forth to San Mateo office a fair bit that year, often taking a red eye
home from San Jose. Back then the San Jose airport was smaller than it is now,
and was especially quiet at the evenings. Not a lot of dinner options, so
McDonald's it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day I was surprised to recognize Rob Reiner in line right in front of me!
He was traveling with some assistant-type person, patiently waiting. I tend to
not bother celebrities in public, but I was moved to say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sef&lt;/strong&gt;: Hello Mr. Reiner. Forgive me but I just wanted to say how much I enjoy
your work. I'm a really big fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt; (big grin): Hi! What's your name? Thanks for introducing
yourself. What have I done that you like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he genuinely wanted to know. I knew his big films pretty well —
&lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/em&gt; was the most popular, &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt; had been up for
Best Picture, &lt;em&gt;Spinal Tap&lt;/em&gt; is well, Spinal Tap. These are all really great
films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sef&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt;, hands down. I love the story and I love what you
did with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm glad you said that. That's my favorite too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that was more than I'd hoped for. I thanked him and begged off so he
could order his burger and have dinner in peace. But no, in that New Yorker
voice and with a big smile he said, "C'mon, let's have cheeseburgers!" The three
of us all sat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a nice talk over dinner. He asked questions and seemed genuinely
interested in what I did -- work, family. But the highlight was toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt;: What else can I answer for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sef&lt;/strong&gt;: What would you tell someone early in their career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was about thirty years old, so hardly &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; early in my own
career, but I was asking in a genuine way. He answered straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;mark&gt;Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every
day.&lt;/mark&gt; Me, I like writing so I try to do that of it every day if I can.
That's how you get good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then told a few stories about people he'd met who don't do this. I guess when
you're someone like him, people ask you frequently for jobs or if you'd produce
their movie or whatnot. He said he asks what was the last thing they'd written,
or what they were working on now, or what'd they'd written today. And he could
tell if they did it often and did it for fun. If they didn't do it often, then
how good a writer were they likely to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was struck by what a nice and interesting, and interested, person Rob Reiner
was. It was incredibly generous for him to spend time with a fanboy when he
could be off duty and just enjoying his cheeseburger. What a gem.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><category>Media</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/rob-reiner/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>No More Blog Comments</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/enshittification/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;div style="float:right; align:right; width:30%; font-size:150px"&gt;
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;💩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned off comments on this site today. The good people at &lt;a href="https://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; had
provided me with a free service for commenting that had worked for ten-plus
years. But they appear to have gone down the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification"&gt;enshittification&lt;/a&gt; path and
started running a bunch of link-spam right above the comment box on all my
pages. Of course they did. I captured a &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/disqus-enshittified.png"&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see. Boo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on me for entrusting a company to handle content for my personal site in
the first place. Isn't controlling things the whole point of this old-school
blog business? Not a big loss, nobody had posted a comment in a long time. But
still.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Technology</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/enshittification/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Three Months</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/three-months/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google"&gt;off work&lt;/a&gt; for about three months now. It's a
good occasion to take stock of how that's going. In a word, it's been &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/activities.jpeg" alt="Meme from the movie \" step brothers\" showing men playing in a bedroom with the caption \"we have so much room for activities.\"" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised how much lighter my mood is. It feels like a weight that I've
  been carrying around for some time is no longer there. It's different than
  being on vacation, better actually. I didn't appreciate how stressful
  tech management has been all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm taking a ton of pleasure in simple things. I go grocery shopping almost
  every day, I'm doing a ton of cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels good to get healthier. I had knee surgery and am recovering from that
  just fine. I exercise nearly every day. On days that I don't go to &lt;a href="https://www.bayclubs.com/clubs/redwoodshores"&gt;the
  gym&lt;/a&gt; I do thirty minutes on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's great to have flexibility. I hadn't planned to see my Dad on his 80th
  birthday because we'd on a bigger group thing later. But on a whim I drove
  down and took him out for breakfast on his actual birthday, because why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I didn't want to do it before, I still don't want to do it. The closet
  hasn't gotten cleaned out; neither has the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Rachel Grey has a three month head start leaving Google. Her
writing this resonates with me. Especially this from recent LinkedIn post
(&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rachel-grey-b69319_after-six-months-out-of-tech-my-primary-ugcPost-7383907826374582272-yCCs"&gt;private, sorry&lt;/a&gt;): "one month off per year of service is a good rule of
thumb; after six of them, I'm still feeling like a sailor who just barely
managed to swim to shore." Maybe that's still where I'm at too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what have I been doing?  I'm prioritizing friends and family — I'm
lucky to have a lot of people I care about. I'm embarrassed that I haven't
always been good about staying in touch, but I can fix that now. And fun stuff
like &lt;a href="https://planet-bridge.org/index.php"&gt;bridge lessons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I'm getting involved with a couple of small projects but nothing
serious yet. When I find something interesting, I'll write about it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/three-months/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Leaving Google</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/google-10year.jpeg" alt="Sef holding a framed certificate, Google ten years of service." width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An offer of a Voluntary Exit from Google HR landed in my mailbox right around my
ten-year anniversary with the company, give or take. We'd had a couple of
packages like this at Google before (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;), basically the same deal you'd
get if you got laid off. But this was the first one put in front of those of us
working in one of the revenue engines of the company — I worked on Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't aiming to leave. I liked the work, I had a good team and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwinton/"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;. But
the package was enough to kickstart a discussion, "why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; now?". My wife and
I ran numbers and discussed our futures. I clicked the button. My last day as a
Googler was earlier this week, October 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have good feelings about my time at Google. It was nice that I saw a some
different parts of the business: some consumer (three years at YouTube, four
years at Search) and some enterprise (three years at Cloud). I got to play with
big infrastructure and solve some hard problems. I saw behind the curtain. But
the best part was the smart and interesting people I got to work with. I know
it's a cliche, but it's the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything was great. I've decided to not use this space for dishy stories
about how Google isn't all it claims to be. But I sure do love reminiscing and
grousing as much as any engineer. If you want to share war stories over a beer,
I'm always up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's next? I haven't decided if this is retirement, or a sabbatical, or
something else. I've been off work for extended stretches twice before, once by
choice and once not. Those two times taught me that the difference between a
wonderful, mind-expanding time and a stress-fest is my own mindset. And now
that I haven't been really working for six weeks now, I can confidently say
that my mindset is positive and good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited about the next phase. I feel fortunate to have some time to focus on
what's important.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><category>Technology</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Good Interview Question</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/interview-question/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/python.png" alt="Python language logo" width="25%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the question that I got when interviewing at YouTube in 2015. At Google
then we'd have an interview panel of four or five people, each assigned to cover
a different area. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billy-biggs-7ab1023/"&gt;Billy Biggs&lt;/a&gt; was the TL on my panel asked to evaluate
"architecture." For a manager candidate that mostly meant evaluating technical
cluefulness (someone else had me do some simple &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201205fizzbuzz-for-managers"&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy's question: &lt;strong&gt;Discuss what would cause a Python interpreter to crash. Not
a &lt;em&gt;program written in Python&lt;/em&gt;, but the interpreter itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember this leading to a fun, rambling, back-and-forth discussion of the
&lt;strong&gt;ways computers can fail&lt;/strong&gt;. There are so many! Every level of the stack can
fail in interesting ways: storage, RAM, memory management, networking. How would
a bit flip in a TLB manifest? How does TCP/IP detect and handle ordering?
collisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also covered a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;engineering and process questions&lt;/strong&gt;. How is the
interpreter itself implemented, in what language and by whom? What would the
quality processes be like for a product like that, especially given Python is
presumably a really large open source project? How would you manage this? How
important to quality is the role of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life"&gt;BDFL&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then that lead to a some more interesting higher-level discussions about the
actual &lt;strong&gt;costs and benefits of addressing failures&lt;/strong&gt; like these in the field.
When should programs hard-fail versus detect and recover? How would you staff an
engineering team to find and chase down errors? What's the user impact to a
failure like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about this question is most likely it was something
they'd actually seen right in their backyard. In 2015 significant parts of
YouTube was &lt;a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-December/070323.html"&gt;written in Python&lt;/a&gt; (that's likely not the case anymore, I don't
know). Crashes like these must have come up in the field. Not only are
real-world problems relatively easy to ask, but they have the added benefit of
showing the candidate the kinds of issues that the team actually deals with. It's
also a well-shaped question: open ended, no right/wrong answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Engineering</category><category>Management</category><category>War Stories</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/interview-question/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Naming Is Hard</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/naming/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/lena.png" alt="Photo of Lena Forsén" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about how hard it is to come up with a good name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in 2013. I was part of a team building a &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201207on-line-education/"&gt;system for online
education&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford. We &lt;a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-launches-class2go-open-source-platform-online-classes"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a nice little site,
Class2Go, with a small team in a few months. It worked well and
supported the basic features of an online course: videos, assessments,
auth, reporting. We decided to keep it going and worked on it for
another year, expanding the covered use cases and taking on more
classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even from the beginning the name &lt;em&gt;Class2Go&lt;/em&gt; felt a bit off. Our
original aim was to enable offline &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;MOOC&lt;/a&gt; students, people trying
to take classes offline or in poorly-connected places But we ended
up pivoting away from the offline use case to more standard
hosted-course features. It became a little multi-tenant CMS with a
small database for auth, assessment results, and some basic analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to rebrand. Someone knew a naming consultant, presumably
an alum, and soon enough we had an expert on board. They were really
interesting to work with. After understanding the platform's goals
and features, they generated hundreds of candidate names. Each was
vetting for domain name availability and copyright conflicts. The
consultant was good at their job, bringing us something like a hundred
candidate names (I wish I still had that list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One name caught everyone's attention: &lt;strong&gt;Tindra&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a Swedish
word that means "sparkle" or "twinkle." It's evocative and easy to
say. It also happens to be a woman's name, but not a particularly
common one we were told. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, &lt;code&gt;tindra.com&lt;/code&gt; was available! In 2013 short and catchy
domain names were getting hard to come The &lt;a href="https://newgtldprogram.icann.org/"&gt;new gTLD program&lt;/a&gt; had
only just been approved in 2012, and &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; were pretty
crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that if you Googled "tindra," the top result was a
Swedish adult film actress! Not good. Maybe with enough SEO juice,
over time, we would have overtaken that. But on launch day, that's
not the association you want to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up punting on the problem and going with a generic name,
&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Online&lt;/strong&gt;. It got the job done, but felt like a missed
opportunity. We later merged with edX and &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-stanford/"&gt;I found another job&lt;/a&gt;.
Eventually the team re-branded the site with the name &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.stanford.edu/lagunita-learning-platform"&gt;Lagunita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,
the name of the lake on campus, which they're still using today. I
like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I still have a thing for Tindra though. The name, not the actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postscript: &lt;code&gt;tindra.com&lt;/code&gt; still doesn't seem to be used for anything
today. It looks to just be parked by a German domain registrar.
Google results don't seem to be a problem. Maybe it's available for
something interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What's the value of an experiment or a prototype?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of ways to have impact. A feature can improve user
experience; a hardening project can reduce risk of a production outage;
refactoring or test coverage can improve velocity or make software easier and
safer to maintain. And good engineers care a lot about impact. While it's not
the only thing that matters (the "how" is important too), if you start with
impact, you'll generally do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer's job to put ideas into practice, to make things. But sometimes
we're not sure what to make. Or we think we know, but aren't sure it'll work.
The best way to figure that out is often running a set of experiments, or maybe
building a prototype (an n=1 experiment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But crucially, an experiment doesn't have value itself. An experiment is
successful only if we've learned something. The intent of the test rig or
prototype isn't to live on. Indeed, knowing that we plan to throw it away is
part of what makes it fast and cheap to build, and it shouldn't have all the
trappings of production-quality software, like test coverage and code reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we ensure that value gets delivered? When you work in a team or a
company people turn over. It's not just enough to do the experiment, you need to
write it up and share your results. To produce a good writeup, you should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure out the hypothesis(es)&lt;/strong&gt; you're testing. Often this is in the form
   of one or more questions. For prototypes, it might be a boolean, i.e. we can
   build X that will work. But even then, consider what "done" means. Stating
   your hypothesis in terms of a metric is often easiest. NB I find the
   goal/driver/guardrail framework from Thanks &lt;a href="https://research.google/people/author3770/?&amp;amp;type=google"&gt;Diane&lt;/a&gt;'s book helpful,
   &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Trustworthy_Online_Controlled_Experiment/TFjPDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1"&gt;Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State your assumptions and method&lt;/strong&gt;. This is where you usually get the most
   feedback. Note that this usually isn't a project plan, as your reviewers
   usually don't care how long it takes or what happens when. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek feedback&lt;/strong&gt; from your peers. Publish the doc stating the method to have
   smart people poke holes in your plan and make sure what you're measuring will
   actually address the hypothesis. And then when the experiment is done, get it
   reviewed by someone senior to ensure that your work supports your conclusion.
   This also spreads knowledge about this work (both that you're doing it, and
   the results) so the overall organization benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artifact produced has many benefits. It's useful for you as you discuss
follow-on work; it's useful come performance evaluation time. But most
importantly, it benefits the organization. Contemporary and future peers can
learn from this work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll benefit from taking the time to write it up, the reviewers learn from
reading, and it'll live on past your time with the team.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Data</category><category>Engineering</category><category>Management</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/experiments/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sponsoring</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/sponsoring/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/sponsor.png" alt="One person helping another while being graded" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sponsorship is using your position and influence to help someone get ahead. It's
similar in many ways to mentorship, the topic of my &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/mentoring"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;.
But sponsorship is a bit tricker. Most people understand mentorship
and have good feelings about it. Sponsorship is a bit less familiar and might
even feel a bit unseemly — at least it used to feel that way to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I'd heard the concept before, a talk &lt;a href="https://www.carlaspearls.com/"&gt;Carla Harris&lt;/a&gt; gave at Google in
2022 made an impression on me and brought it to the forefront. (She has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpE_W50OTUc"&gt;2019
TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; that hits a lot of the same points). She spoke about the value of
sponsorship, both on the receiving end early in her career and now as a sponsor
herself. More than just her description, what I most appreciated was her candor.
It gave me a permission structure to use this concept myself. I started using it
with junior engineers when thinking about their careers; I thought about it
myself when debugging how some decision played out. It also helped me to think
of it less judgmentally. Now I see it as being thoughtful and pragmatic about
how decisions are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what it it? Sponsoring is similar to mentoring in that it's an investment in
someone, but the mechanism is different. Mentoring is a commitment to
problem-solve issues as they come up, teach skills, and serve as a sounding
board, amongst other things. Sponsoring is more strategic. The sponsor is
committing to understand the sponsored's goals and strengths, and (here's the
important part) help them get ahead. The time commitment isn't as large, but the
&lt;em&gt;actual commitment&lt;/em&gt; is greater. Assuming they see eye-to-eye, the sponsor
commits to &lt;em&gt;putting their reputation on the line&lt;/em&gt; to help the their person
achieve their goals. Some examples would be vouching for the sponsored during a
staffing conversations or seeking out and advocating for them when opportunities
comes up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, sponsorship acknowledges and even co-opts the "you have to know
somebody" way that the world actually works. Underrepresented groups can benefit
from sponsorship as a way to wedge into existing power structures. If that
describes you, consider asking for someone to explicitly sponsor you; if you're
in a traditionally privileged group, consider sponsoring someone who isn't so
much.  My Google peer &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-grey-b69319/"&gt;Rachel&lt;/a&gt; observed: "women are often over-mentored and
under-sponsored."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Maybe You're Going Up For Promotion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, let's apply this to promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try as we might to bring rigor and de-bias these decisions, they are complicated
and are made by real-world humans. Organizations rely on their senior people to
bring their experience, knowledge, and judgment to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider how the promotion decision will be made for your case. One key question
is &lt;strong&gt;who'll be in the room&lt;/strong&gt;? This isn't just who is invited and who will
attend, but more who will be &lt;strong&gt;influential&lt;/strong&gt; in the discussion and decision
making process, and &lt;strong&gt;for what&lt;/strong&gt; kinds of questions. Not everyone has an equal
voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you're an engineer going up for promotion to senior engineer. Then likely a
senior tech lead (not necessarily &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; tech lead!) will be asked to speak to
the quality of your work (e.g. good code, considered alternatives,
future-proofing). A senior manager will likely be asked to assess how well you
worked with others and made good decisions. And these are just two of the
factors — there will be many others depending on your role and level. You
need to work down the rubric and think through who'll be asked to attest to each
area as it comes up. Who will be asked to speak to concerns when they're raised
("was that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; that hard?")?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you might know who the key person will be, but often you won't. Enlist
your manager or other senior leaders to think it through with you. Game plan the
decision out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then assess their level of support. This may be something you can do
yourself (if you have a relationship already) or maybe you'll need your
manager's help. But somehow you need to ask them, as candidly as you can, "If
asked about X, what will you say?" It can sometimes be hard to get an honest
answer, so you may need to push a little. Reassure them you'd much rather know
now if you have their support or not and you're not going to hold it against
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't have their support yet, that's OK. Think about work you can do
to change that over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day-To-Day Decisions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all decisions are as high-stakes as promotions. Leaders make decisions all
the time, like whom to trust to lead a project or run a meeting. I like to think
about these small-but-important decisions too in the context of sponsorship. Is
your manager your sponsor? What about your TL?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you're looking for a mentor, that's great! I've benefitted a lot
from mentors in my career. It'll be a valuable experience for
both you and your mentor. This post has my tips for finding a good
mentor, asking them, and maintaining a good ongoing relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Choosing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are my three go-to rules for finding a mentor. They've held
up across many companies and years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Your mentor should be &lt;strong&gt;someone you admire&lt;/strong&gt;. The best choice
is usually someone the same career path as you, but further along
by some years. They don't have to be so much more senior, it could
just be the next step, but they've shown that they're willing and
able to take on more responsibility and how to do it at your company.
Ideally they're someone interesting, inspirational, and relateable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another type of mentoring relationship is when you're looking to
make a change — say from Engineer to Engineering Manager, or
Engineering Manager to Product Manager. Then you're looking for
someone who made the switch. I find they're often the most eager
to talk about how and why they did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Organizationally close-by is OK, but they &lt;strong&gt;shouldn't be one
of your leaders&lt;/strong&gt;. I've gotten the most out of mentors outside my
chain of command. That way, I never had to worry about choosing my
words (or topics) carefully. I could problem solve or just vent.
Sometimes the person you need to discuss is your own
&lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/problem-or-solution-boss"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Rapport is super important&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe the most important thing
of all. Your meetings can't feel like a chore for either of you.
Even if you've gotten along fine in the past, maybe you'll hit it
off in this new relationship, maybe now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you find the right person if it's not obvious who to ask? Use
your network, talk to people, ask for referrals. Big companies often
have mentoring programs for matchmaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Asking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While your mentor will benefit a bit, you'll be the one getting the
most out of this deal. So it's up to you to ask. Understand that
they're likely busy, so say how much you'd appreciate some of their
time. Make sure they know it's OK to say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend asking for a trial run to start with: "Let's do three
or four meetings and then re-evaluate." That way you can make sure
that it's clicking, see the "rapport" criteria above. If it's not
feeling great &lt;em&gt;on both sides&lt;/em&gt; then it's best to try again with
someone else, no harm no foul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Being A Good Mentee&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you've found someone, great. Here's some things you should do
during probation and onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Respect their time&lt;/strong&gt;. Be prompt. Work around their schedule
and in a way that works best for them (30 min? over a meal?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Come prepared with a topic or two&lt;/strong&gt;, keep a backlog. It can
be something specific, like problem solving a particular situation
or relationship. Or it could be getting just-in-time feedback on a
draft email or document. Or it could be open-ended, e.g. "if you
could advise your former self 10 years ago, what would you have
said?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Check in&lt;/strong&gt; from time to time. Make sure this is still working
out for them: the style of meeting, duration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Find an appropriate way to &lt;strong&gt;thank them&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing big but it's
important to show that you appreciate their time. For example at
my current employer (Google) we have a system to give shout-outs
to peers that come up at performance review time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, find a way to &lt;strong&gt;pay it forward&lt;/strong&gt;. Introduce mentors and
mentees; volunteer in your company's matchmaking service; find
people who appear to stranded and offer to help them out. Sending
this post might be a fine icebreaker.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Management</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/mentoring/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2024 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
