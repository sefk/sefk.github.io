&lt;p&gt;I just finished listening to the &lt;a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"&gt;Big Dig podcast&lt;/a&gt; and it's worth
a listen. It's about Boston's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig"&gt;Central Artery/Tunnel Project&lt;/a&gt;,
the most expensive highway project in US history. It covers the
whole story, from conception, to getting it approved, to years of
execution, and then the fallout from cost overruns and mismanagement.
The podcast is well produced and has a lot of primary-source
interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a little bit of a personal connection, since I lived in
Boston during those later years and it was on the news &lt;em&gt;all the
time&lt;/em&gt;. I even got a tour of a part when it was under construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how they use this story to speak to something larger: can
America build big infrastructure anymore? It's something I think
lot about. We benefit from by the giant projects from the past
(dams, bridges, interstates) but struggle to maintain them properly today.
We struggle to do new things like proper &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail"&gt;high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their claim is this is partially due to headwinds that didn't exist
in the public-works heydey in the twentieth century. Leaders are
under much more scrutiny; projects fall under many new regulations
protecting the environment and worker safety. While the old way was
faster and cheaper, it also caused a lot of harm. Public works
projects are so big and disruptive that high cost and long times
are likely unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ends on a hopeful note. Not that it's easy, nor are we necessarily
that much better managing big projects now. But there are success
stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially liked an interview &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+BDdBHAXcVU/20:47"&gt;20 minutes into the final episode&lt;/a&gt;
with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_P._Salvucci"&gt;Fred Salvucci&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the story Saint Francis. God tells
Francis to build a cathedral, but then keeps tears it down. Why?
because it's not enough to build a physical cathedral, but you also
have to build the support for it in the hearts and minds of the
people. Maybe that's the part that we're not doing well enough these
days and is blocking our ability to build big things.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/big-dig/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bring Me {Problem,Solution} Bosses</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/problem-or-solution-boss/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="Pointy-Haired-Boss" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/Pointy-Haired_Boss.png" alt="Pointy Haired Boss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bosses want you to &lt;em&gt;bring them problems&lt;/em&gt;. They like to unscramble
Rubik's cubes and are happy to work through it with you. Sure it's great if you have a proposal or recommendation,
but be prepared to show your homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other bosses want you to &lt;em&gt;bring them solutions&lt;/em&gt;. If you
bring them a problem, you'll get annoyance and "what do you want
me to do about it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bosses have exceptions by domain. A common patter there is the
techie bring-me-problems boss who'll want to dig in on capacity
planning, say, but hope you can solve messy people conflicts yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked with both and each has their virtues. When you have a new
boss, figure out what type they are and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/problem-or-solution-boss/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Working In The Open</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/working-in-the-open/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/hachyderm-debugging.png" alt="screenshot of @nova live-debugging Hachyderm on Twitch" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day my daughter asked me about Software Engineering -- what do
we &lt;em&gt;actually do&lt;/em&gt;? She's eighteen and probably won't follow in my
footsteps, which is fine, but I still want her to see my field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always found this question hard to answer. I've been an engineering
manager for a long time, and I'm happy to describe that job (emails,
1:1's, PRD reviews), but I don't think that's the heart of it. Plus
these days I work for Google where things there are proprietary and
deeply layered, not much help for answering questions like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've found my way to Mastodon for &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@sefk/109456480817920873"&gt;obvious reasons&lt;/a&gt;. I
chose the &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/"&gt;Hachyderm&lt;/a&gt; instance because it was well run by people who
shared my values. It turns out that the values of the owners and
operators of the things we use matter, huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then learned a cool thing, that the Hachyderm admins do much of their
work publicly. They livestream debugging sessions on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/krisnova"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, they write
postmortems, they share live &lt;a href="https://grafana.hachyderm.io/public-dashboards/445bbb0e169f4e86b1d1eeee7e50c92a"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@nova"&gt;@nova&lt;/a&gt; happened to be
live-streaming at that moment, not surprising since the team's been busy
absorbing thousands of new users and fending off attacks. My daughter
and I watched a bit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Hachyderm (&lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@nova"&gt;@nova&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@dma"&gt;@dma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@quintessence"&gt;@quintessence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@Taniwha"&gt;@Taniwha&lt;/a&gt;

Or more
precisely, how many combinations of seven letters can be used to build Bee-type
puzzles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out &lt;strong&gt;7,742 different seven letter combinations&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to
generate Bee-style puzzles. There are more puzzles themseves based on what
letter is chosen for the middle spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of letter choices, about 62%, have just one pangram. That's lower
than I expected, actually. It's not that uncommon to have two or three pangrams,
which happens about about 25% of the time, and nearly four out of ten puzzles
will have more than one pangram. The full output is &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefk/timesbee/master/timesbee.out"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the output of this
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/timesbee"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the combination &lt;code&gt;einprst&lt;/code&gt;. If this one ever comes up, good
luck finding all twenty-seven of its pangrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bee Puzzle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/timesbee.png" alt="Example Times Bee Puzzle" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bee puzzle has seven letters with one "special" letter in the middle. Make as
many words as You can find with at least four letters, using only the letters
given, but it has to use the center letter. Proper nouns aren't allowed. Every
puzzle has at least one &lt;strong&gt;pangram&lt;/strong&gt;, a word that uses all letters â€” this
example's is &lt;em&gt;amphibian&lt;/em&gt;. Wikipedia cites &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Longo"&gt;Frank Longo&lt;/a&gt; as the Bee's creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytbee.com/"&gt;nytbee.com&lt;/a&gt; has more today's puzzle and some interesting stats about these
puzzles in general. They don't seem to be affiliated with the NY Times but that
seem to be OK and is's a nice site.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Family</category><category>Games</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/timesbee/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Flat</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/halloween-2015/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Trick-or-treaters volume at our Menlo Park house this Halloween was basically flat compared to last
year. Last year we had 208 trick-or-treaters, this year 211. We remain down quite a bit from our 2012
peak. Maybe this is the new norm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="690" height="380" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-7ftYzue_VQl4lt-QNFU_UfeDAROg47-1tlOzIw5Vk/pubchart?oid=17&amp;amp;format=interactive"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything happened later this year. Our first trick-or-treater didn't show up until 6:30, and
peak wasn't until 8:45. That's thirty minutes or more later than prior years. I speculate it's because
it was a warm weekend night. Why not stay out a bit later, no school tomorrow. And with the fall-back
DST change everyone would be looking foward to a "free" hour of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to start my new job at YouTube in a few weeks. I'll manage the
engineering team building the data warehouse for usage metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that YouTube is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt;. It's firmly a part of our culture
and I'm sure it will be how my kids watch video. YouTube's impressive
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; are the result. You don't see usage like that without a
bunch of &lt;strong&gt;hard problems&lt;/strong&gt;, and hard problems attract &lt;strong&gt;bright people&lt;/strong&gt;.
Indeed that's the clincher for why I'm looking forward to working there.
People vote with their feet, and I have a lot of friends who have opted
for Google, and YouTube specifically. They tell me that it's a great place
to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is one of the worlds foremost platforms for social commentary,
education, and free speech. And it's plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt; too. Sounds
like fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/youtube/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2015 06:25:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thick Apps Still Lose </title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/thick-apps/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/online-required.png" alt="Microsoft Excel 2016 Error Message" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thick apps won mobile. Fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On laptop (and desktop) it's not so clear. What is better, thick or thin?
I tend to live mostly in thin land, although I use some thick apps
regularly, like Twitter's Mac client and Apple Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every so often I give a big native app a try: &lt;strong&gt;Excel&lt;/strong&gt; instead of
&lt;strong&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mail.app&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;Gmail&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Reminders&lt;/strong&gt;
instead of the barebones &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt; built into Gmail. (I can't bring myself
to try Word). But it's disappointing to see how those fancy apps keep
shooting themselves in the foot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example this Excel error message. Excel is whining that it
can't verify my subscription the first time I ran Excel untethered
(version 15.11.2, for what its worth). Sure you can click through the
warning, but would a newbie know to do that? At best off-putting, at worst
downright disorienting. Why warn me of this at all? And why in a modal
that stops me dead in my tracks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems thick apps should win. They rock the unplugged use case. An even
better situation is flaky networks -- tethered, conference WiFi,
travelling. UI's deal notoriously poorly with intermittent or partial
outages. A thick client, relying on that connection only for hitting
API's, can hide the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place they should shine is the UI itself. They should be fast,
beautiful, and featureful. Too often they're not. For example I find
Mail.app to be clunky, difficult to customize, and its keyboard shortcuts
few and poorly done. Gmail is pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there's the upgrade problem. Thick apps need conscious effort from
their users before their work sees user time and they get feedback. And
that's what drives innovation. Long cycles means slower (less) invention.
One example I love is Gmail's "undo send" feature. Boy, you sure do miss
that when you need it and it's not there! That should be on every thick
client by now, but I don't think it is. I do know that Gmail has it and
Mail.app still doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the Internet can help. Look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getchrome.com/"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with its awesome auto
updates. What makes this work is solid engineering and exceptional quality
control. I've never seen behind the Google curtain, but I bet there's no
magic, just a lot of good engineering that leads to good software. Like:
good design and code reviews, tons of test coverage across many scenarios,
diverse and well-instrumented canaries, and thorough performance and
resource use testing. If Google didn't all of that so well, then we
wouldn't accept frequent pushes. Without the frequent upgrade cycle,
Chromes feature cycle would languish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getelectron.com/"&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is another bright spot. This is the framework that gives
Slack and GitHub's thick clients their fit and finish. It makes these feel
like true native apps, even though they are mostly web controls with
JavaScript the covers. Right-clicking still doesn't do what I want, and
text controls are finicky, but it's close. But what those rough edges buy
you, and the software producer, are frequent, reliable, and clean
upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My natural preference would be for thick apps. If they were done well,
I'd use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/thick-apps/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 20:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>My Next Job</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/job-15/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/snowflake.png" alt="Snowflake" width="25%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left &lt;a href="http://www.wavefront.com/"&gt;my last job&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks back and it's high time to look for a new
one. If you're working on something interesting and think I could help, &lt;a href="mailto:sefklon@gmail.com"&gt;let
me know&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice to not have a day job while looking for another. I was lucky enough
to do this &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201204my-sabbatical.html"&gt;once before in 2012&lt;/a&gt; which turned out great. I learned then
that time and flexibility lets you talk to lots of friends and learn about a
breadth of projects. I found a fun project in a new domain (&lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201207on-line-education.html"&gt;online
education&lt;/a&gt;), something I doubt I'd have found the normal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll get lucky again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough small talk, what am I looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for some flavor of &lt;strong&gt;line manager&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm a good senior manager and
code-every-day engineer; but I'm exceptional leading a team and running a
project. That's what line managers do: lead engineers, not other managers or
departments or matrix-anything. Also, if you're some kind of executive then
coding is an indulgence, and I'd rather it just be part of my job. Mostly I'm
talking to &lt;strong&gt;small companies&lt;/strong&gt;, say 10-100 people (fun-size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to &lt;strong&gt;build on my experience&lt;/strong&gt;. I know infrastructure and cloud, SaaS
and enterprise, and online education. I'm probably not the best person for
your storage, security, gaming, e-commerce, or cryptocurrency company. I want
to stay working on &lt;strong&gt;Internet technology&lt;/strong&gt;. I like the (micro)services model.
For my own projects I choose Python, JavaScript (frontend and backend), and
Java. I know web operations, especially the &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/aws.html"&gt;Amazon stack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt; is important: I don't want to do a daily Menlo Park to San
Francisco round-trip. I'd like to &lt;strong&gt;work with friends&lt;/strong&gt; if possible. And I
want to do something &lt;strong&gt;worthwhile&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always get to my resume from the header here, or via this &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/sef-resume"&gt;short
link&lt;/a&gt;. I'm open to a bunch of things, just no &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgu7jdc_fs"&gt;kick boxing&lt;/a&gt;.  Let's
have coffee/drink or take a walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/job-15/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2015 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Perspective</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/petrol-car/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;div style="float:right; padding-left:15px;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent the last three years building and operating web sites
with Amazon Web Services and here are a few lessons I've learned. 
But I first have to come clean that I'm a fan of AWS with only
casual experience with other IAAS/PAAS platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S3 Is Amazing&lt;/strong&gt;. They made the right engineering choices and
compromises: cheap, practically infinitely scalable, fast enough,
with good availability. $0.03/GB/mo covers up for a lot of sins.
Knowing it's there changes how you build systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM Machine Roles From The Start&lt;/strong&gt;. IAM with &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html"&gt;Instance Metadata&lt;/a&gt;
is a powerful way to manage secrets and rights. Trouble is you can't add
to existing machines. Provision with machine roles in big categories
(e.g. app servers, utility machines, databases) at the start, even if 
just placeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Availability Zoness Are Only Mostly Decoupled&lt;/strong&gt;. After the 2011
&lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2202805/cloud-computing/amazon-ec2-outage-calls--availability-zones--into-question.html"&gt;us-east-1 outage&lt;/a&gt; we were reassured that a coordinated 
outage wouldn't happen again, but it happened again just
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/2zpag7/aws_internal_dns_outage/"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They Will Lock You In And You'll Like It&lt;/strong&gt;. They secondary services
work well, are cheap, and are handy. I'm speaking of SQS, SES,
Glacier, even Elastic Transcoder. Who &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to run a durable queue
again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CloudFormation No&lt;/strong&gt;. It's tough to get right. My
objection isn't programming in YAML, I don't mind writing Ansible plays, it's the
complexity/structure of CloudFormation that is impenetrable. Plus
even if you get it working once, you'd never run it again on something
that is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boto Yes&lt;/strong&gt;. Powerful and expressive. Don't script the CLI, use
Boto. Easy as pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualify Machines Before Use&lt;/strong&gt;. Some VMs have lousy networking,
presumably due to a chatty same-host or same-rack neighbor. Test
for loss and latency to other hosts you own and on EBS. (I've used
home-grown scripts, don't know of a standard open-source widget,
someone should write one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPC Yes&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have machines talking to each other (i.e. not a
lone machine doing something lonely) then put them in a VPC. It's not
hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NAT No&lt;/strong&gt;. You think that'll improve security, but it will just
introduce SPOFS and capacity chokepoints. Give your machines publicly
routable IP's and use security groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network ACLs Are A Pain&lt;/strong&gt;. Try to get as far as you can with just security
groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You'll Peer VPC's Someday&lt;/strong&gt;. Choose non-overlapping subnet IP ranges
at the start. It's hard to change later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spot Instances Are Tricky&lt;/strong&gt;. They're only For a very specific use
case that likely isn't yours. Setting up a test network? You can
spend the money you save by using spot on swear jar fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a Management Toolset&lt;/strong&gt;. Ansible, Chef, all those things aren't
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that different when it comes down to it. Just don't dither back
and forth. There's a little bit of extra Chef love w/ AWS but not enough to tip
the scales in your decision I'd reckon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Support Is Terrible&lt;/strong&gt;. My &lt;a href="http://www.wavefront.com/"&gt;last little
startup&lt;/a&gt; didn't get much out of the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/"&gt;business level tech
support&lt;/a&gt; we bought. We needed it so we could call in to get
help when we needed it, and we used that for escalating some problems.
It was nice to have a number to call when I urgently need to up a
system limit, say. But debugging something real, like a networking
problem? Pretty rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...Unless You Are Big&lt;/strong&gt;. Stanford, on the other hand, had a named
rep who was responsive and helpful. I guess she was sales, but I
used her freely on support issues and she worked the backchannels
for us. Presumably this is what any big/important customer would
get, that's just not you, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Power Is On Demand&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm reaffirming cloud
koolaid here. Running this way lets you build and run systems
differently, &lt;em&gt;much better&lt;/em&gt;. I've relied on the cloud this to bring
up emergency capacity. I've used it to convert a class of machines
on the fly to the double-price double-RAM tier when hitting a
surprising capacity crunch. There are a whole class of problems
that get much easier when you can have 2x the machines for just a
little while.  When someone comes to you with that cost/benefit
spreadsheet arguing why you should self-host, that's when you need
your file of "the cloud saved my bacon" stories at the ready.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/aws/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2015 07:10:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
