&lt;p&gt;I listen to a fair number of podcasts. The &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/"&gt;Accidental Tech
Podcast&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite by a mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the one that I look forward to every week. It comes out on
Thursdays, often right when I'm leaving work. It's a sign that
the weekend is right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll get some of the reasons why out of the way quickly, the reasons
particular to me and my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The topic, the world of technology and all things around it,
  is right in my wheelhouse. It's my profession, but also my hobby.
  That's what got me in the door. If this stuff isn't your thing,
  then this podcast won't be either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They talk a lot about Apple products and that ecosystem, which
  where I spend my personal time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But they also cover a lot of issues that touch on the world of
  technology: business, law &amp;amp; politics, companies, social media.
  I like their descriptions, their take, their rants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They end up talking a lot about personal tech too. Like how to
  manage family photos and backups. The hard, fussy stuff that ends
  up taking up so much of our lives. For example, what's the best
  way to help parents deal with passwords. Hard stuff!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I especially like tech-adjacent topics like home audio/video,
  home automation, and gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I appreciate more than the content of ATP are the
hosts and the care and they take to produce a good show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;friends&lt;/strong&gt;. It's nice hanging out with people
  who like each other. It's kind of like we have permission
  to eavesdrop and be a part of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're not afraid to discuss &lt;strong&gt;their lives&lt;/strong&gt;.
  Stuff like families and work/life stress.
  This is good stuff for me because I'm in that the same life
  situation as them, middle-aged tech dads.
  But bringing their whole selves
  to the show is a bit of vulnerability that I appreciate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ATP is &lt;strong&gt;exceptionally well produced&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn't
  appreciate this until I'd heard so many other podcasts that
  are produced terribly, with bad recordings or poorly mixed.
  Usually you have to turn to the corporate, fancy
  podcasts, but they also have lots of ads and are
  usually different kinds of shows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the show is so &lt;strong&gt;well edited&lt;/strong&gt;. They edit it without
  losing any of the content or the pacing, and sparing us all the
  awkward "um where were we" and technical futzing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They &lt;strong&gt;don't talk over each other&lt;/strong&gt;. Part of this is discipline,
  part of this is just politeness. But also now that I've listened
  to the pre-edit "bootleg" a couple of times, I've come to appreciate
  how much of this is also fixed in the edit.  Nice job Marco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are &lt;strong&gt;respectful&lt;/strong&gt;.  They don't put people down, they aren't
  mean.  When they kid each other it's in good fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When (rarely) they wade into social justice or
  world events, they do so respectfully and thoughtfully.
  They understand that as three three cis-gendered white guys,
  it's good to have views to share, but also right to listen
  and help others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Their show is &lt;strong&gt;reliable&lt;/strong&gt;. It's great that they keep to a
  regular format schedule. It fits into the rest of your life
  and becomes something you count on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, some small things: Yay for proper use of
  &lt;strong&gt;chapter markers&lt;/strong&gt;, hardly anybody else does. And I like their
  their occasional forays into &lt;strong&gt;car talk&lt;/strong&gt;, just because I like car
  stuff too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they joke about how much of the show is devoted to feedback,
it's one of my favorite parts. It shows that they listen and are
learning.  And they share that learning with all of us. A recent
example was six minutes or so into &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/570"&gt;Episode 570&lt;/a&gt; when I learned
how home power battery systems, when full, signal this by changing
&lt;em&gt;the frequency of AC power&lt;/em&gt; as a signal to solar panels to back off.
Fascinating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the members-only specials. It's OK with me that these are only
available to members.
I like how candid they've been talking about ad revenue drying up
recently and they could use the extra revenue channel. these
episodes are a nice way to reward members. They've managed to
do these without compromising the core show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing they ever did on ATP was getting a sponsor to send John
toasters to review. And &lt;a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/9/10/siracusa-on-toasters"&gt;review he did&lt;/a&gt;! I didn't appreciate how
many bad toasters there are, and how they can be bad for so many
reasons. My favorite reason was poor &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/knobfeel"&gt;knob feel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice work &lt;a href="https://hypercritical.co/"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://marco.org/"&gt;Marco&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://caseyliss.com/"&gt;Casey&lt;/a&gt;.
Please keep it up for a long, long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/atp/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The iPhone's SIM Tray Went Away Too Soon</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/esim/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/sim.png" alt="SIM" width="25%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've traveled internationally, likely you've used a SIM card
for local data and calls. There is a nice ecosystem around SIMs
with a wealth of easy and affordable Pay As You Go (PAYG) options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the newer iPhones did away with the SIM slot if favor of some new
eSIM hotness. Apple has all kinds of &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT209096"&gt;info&lt;/a&gt; claiming they have good
international support, but I found reality falls short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only a few carriers support eSIM's,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The few that do require a contract. A tourist or student
   studying abroad is better served by a PAYG plan, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if you can stomach a contract, that would require a UK bank
   account; no way to easily pull that off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up falling back to &lt;a href="https://www.att.com/international/day-pass/"&gt;international roaming&lt;/a&gt;. It works but
is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Apple made the wrong call removing the trusty old SIM tray.
Clearly the new models can be made to work well with it, since how
they are sold in the UK.  If you're unlucky enough to have bought
your recent iPhone in the US, you're out of luck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I this is an example of Apple bad tendency sometimes choose form
over function, "&lt;a href="https://www.theringer.com/2016/9/7/16038622/why-did-apple-remove-the-headphone-jack-courage"&gt;courage&lt;/a&gt;" over usability.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/esim/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 10:34:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Big Dig</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/big-dig/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/bigdig.png" alt="Big Dig podcast title art (WGBH)" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished the &lt;a href="https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig"&gt;Big Dig podcast&lt;/a&gt; and it's worth
a listen. It's about Boston's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Dig"&gt;Central Artery/Tunnel Project&lt;/a&gt;,
the most expensive highway project in US history. They cover the
whole story, from conception, to getting it approved, to years of
execution, and then the fallout from cost overruns and mismanagement.
The podcast is well produced and has a lot of primary-source
interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a little bit of a personal connection, since I lived in
Boston during the project's later years when it was on the news &lt;em&gt;all the
time&lt;/em&gt;. I even toured &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_P._Zakim_Bunker_Hill_Memorial_Bridge"&gt;a part&lt;/a&gt; under construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I find most compelling is trying to connect to the question,
can America build big infrastructure anymore? It's something I think
lot about. We benefit from by the giant projects from the past
(dams, bridges, interstates) but can't maintain them properly; we
struggle to take on new things like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_High-Speed_Rail"&gt;high-speed rail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They place most of the blame on headwinds that didn't exist in the
public-works heyday of the twentieth century. Leaders are under
more scrutiny; projects fall under a bunch of regulations intended
to protect the environment and workers. Public commentary slows
things down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, while the old way was easier, it also caused a lot
of harm. I learned the story of the Cambridge and East Boston
families that stopped interstate projects that would have leveled
their homes and neighborhoods. I know those places well. I used to
own a home right where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_695_(Massachusetts)"&gt;one of those roads was supposed to have
been&lt;/a&gt;. I sure am grateful to those protesters who won!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ends on a hopeful note. Not that it's easy, nor are we necessarily
that much better managing big projects now. But there are success
stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part I especially liked was &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm/+BDdBHAXcVU/20:47"&gt;20 minutes into the final episode&lt;/a&gt;,
in the final interview with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_P._Salvucci"&gt;Fred Salvucci&lt;/a&gt;, where he told the
story Saint Francis. God tells Francis to build a cathedral, but
then tears it down. Francis builds another, God destroys it again.
Why, Francis asks. Because it's not enough to build a physical
cathedral, but you also have to build the support for it in the
hearts and minds of the people. Maybe that's the part we're not
doing well enough now.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/big-dig/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bring Me {Problems,Solutions} Bosses</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/problem-or-solution-boss/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright" title="Pointy-Haired-Boss" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/Pointy-Haired_Boss.png" alt="Pointy Haired Boss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bosses want you to &lt;em&gt;bring them problems&lt;/em&gt;. They like to unscramble
Rubik's cubes and are happy to work through it with you. Sure it's great if you have a proposal or recommendation,
but be prepared to show your homework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other bosses want you to &lt;em&gt;bring them solutions&lt;/em&gt;. If you
bring them a problem, you'll get annoyance and "what do you want
me to do about it?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most bosses have exceptions by domain. A common pattern there is
the bring-me-problems boss who is also a techie -- they'll want to
dig in planning, say, but prefer you to solve messy people conflicts
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked with both and each has their virtues. When you have a new
boss, figure out their style and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/problem-or-solution-boss/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2023 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Working In The Open</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/working-in-the-open/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/hachyderm-debugging.png" alt="screenshot of @nova live-debugging Hachyderm on Twitch" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day my daughter asked me about Software Engineering -- what do
we &lt;em&gt;actually do&lt;/em&gt;? She's eighteen and probably won't follow in my
footsteps, which is fine, but I still want her to see my field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always found this question hard to answer. I've been an engineering
manager for a long time, and I'm happy to describe that job (emails,
1:1's, PRD reviews), but I don't think that's the heart of it. Plus
these days I work for Google where things there are proprietary and
deeply layered, not much help for answering questions like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've found my way to Mastodon for &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@sefk/109456480817920873"&gt;obvious reasons&lt;/a&gt;. I
chose the &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/"&gt;Hachyderm&lt;/a&gt; instance because it was well run by people who
shared my values. It turns out that the values of the owners and
operators of the things we use matter, huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then learned a cool thing, that the Hachyderm admins do much of their
work publicly. They livestream debugging sessions on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/krisnova"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, they write
postmortems, they share live &lt;a href="https://grafana.hachyderm.io/public-dashboards/445bbb0e169f4e86b1d1eeee7e50c92a"&gt;graphs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@nova"&gt;@nova&lt;/a&gt; happened to be
live-streaming at that moment, not surprising since the team's been busy
absorbing thousands of new users and fending off attacks. My daughter
and I watched a bit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Hachyderm (&lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@nova"&gt;@nova&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@dma"&gt;@dma&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@quintessence"&gt;@quintessence&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://hachyderm.io/@Taniwha"&gt;@Taniwha&lt;/a&gt;

Or more
precisely, how many combinations of seven letters can be used to build Bee-type
puzzles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out &lt;strong&gt;7,742 different seven letter combinations&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to
generate Bee-style puzzles. There are more puzzles themseves based on what
letter is chosen for the middle spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of letter choices, about 62%, have just one pangram. That's lower
than I expected, actually. It's not that uncommon to have two or three pangrams,
which happens about about 25% of the time, and nearly four out of ten puzzles
will have more than one pangram. The full output is &lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sefk/timesbee/master/timesbee.out"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, the output of this
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/timesbee"&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out for the combination &lt;code&gt;einprst&lt;/code&gt;. If this one ever comes up, good
luck finding all twenty-seven of its pangrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Bee Puzzle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/timesbee.png" alt="Example Times Bee Puzzle" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bee puzzle has seven letters with one "special" letter in the middle. Make as
many words as You can find with at least four letters, using only the letters
given, but it has to use the center letter. Proper nouns aren't allowed. Every
puzzle has at least one &lt;strong&gt;pangram&lt;/strong&gt;, a word that uses all letters — this
example's is &lt;em&gt;amphibian&lt;/em&gt;. Wikipedia cites &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Longo"&gt;Frank Longo&lt;/a&gt; as the Bee's creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nytbee.com/"&gt;nytbee.com&lt;/a&gt; has more today's puzzle and some interesting stats about these
puzzles in general. They don't seem to be affiliated with the NY Times but that
seem to be OK and is's a nice site.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Family</category><category>Games</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/timesbee/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Flat</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/halloween-2015/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Trick-or-treaters volume at our Menlo Park house this Halloween was basically flat compared to last
year. Last year we had 208 trick-or-treaters, this year 211. We remain down quite a bit from our 2012
peak. Maybe this is the new norm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w-7ftYzue_VQl4lt-QNFU_UfeDAROg47-1tlOzIw5Vk/pubchart?oid=17&amp;amp;format=interactive"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything happened later this year. Our first trick-or-treater didn't show up until 6:30, and
peak wasn't until 8:45. That's thirty minutes or more later than prior years. I speculate it's because
it was a warm weekend night. Why not stay out a bit later, no school tomorrow. And with the fall-back
DST change everyone would be looking foward to a "free" hour of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to start my new job at YouTube in a few weeks. I'll manage the
engineering team building the data warehouse for usage metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that YouTube is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt;. It's firmly a part of our culture
and I'm sure it will be how my kids watch video. YouTube's impressive
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/yt/press/statistics.html"&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; are the result. You don't see usage like that without a
bunch of &lt;strong&gt;hard problems&lt;/strong&gt;, and hard problems attract &lt;strong&gt;bright people&lt;/strong&gt;.
Indeed that's the clincher for why I'm looking forward to working there.
People vote with their feet, and I have a lot of friends who have opted
for Google, and YouTube specifically. They tell me that it's a great place
to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube is one of the worlds foremost platforms for social commentary,
education, and free speech. And it's plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0"&gt;entertainment&lt;/a&gt; too. Sounds
like fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/youtube/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2015 06:25:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thick Apps Still Lose </title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/thick-apps/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/online-required.png" alt="Microsoft Excel 2016 Error Message" width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thick apps won mobile. Fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On laptop (and desktop) it's not so clear. What is better, thick or thin?
I tend to live mostly in thin land, although I use some thick apps
regularly, like Twitter's Mac client and Apple Photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every so often I give a big native app a try: &lt;strong&gt;Excel&lt;/strong&gt; instead of
&lt;strong&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mail.app&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;Gmail&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Reminders&lt;/strong&gt;
instead of the barebones &lt;strong&gt;Tasks&lt;/strong&gt; built into Gmail. (I can't bring myself
to try Word). But it's disappointing to see how those fancy apps keep
shooting themselves in the foot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example this Excel error message. Excel is whining that it
can't verify my subscription the first time I ran Excel untethered
(version 15.11.2, for what its worth). Sure you can click through the
warning, but would a newbie know to do that? At best off-putting, at worst
downright disorienting. Why warn me of this at all? And why in a modal
that stops me dead in my tracks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems thick apps should win. They rock the unplugged use case. An even
better situation is flaky networks -- tethered, conference WiFi,
travelling. UI's deal notoriously poorly with intermittent or partial
outages. A thick client, relying on that connection only for hitting
API's, can hide the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another place they should shine is the UI itself. They should be fast,
beautiful, and featureful. Too often they're not. For example I find
Mail.app to be clunky, difficult to customize, and its keyboard shortcuts
few and poorly done. Gmail is pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there's the upgrade problem. Thick apps need conscious effort from
their users before their work sees user time and they get feedback. And
that's what drives innovation. Long cycles means slower (less) invention.
One example I love is Gmail's "undo send" feature. Boy, you sure do miss
that when you need it and it's not there! That should be on every thick
client by now, but I don't think it is. I do know that Gmail has it and
Mail.app still doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the Internet can help. Look at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getchrome.com/"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with its awesome auto
updates. What makes this work is solid engineering and exceptional quality
control. I've never seen behind the Google curtain, but I bet there's no
magic, just a lot of good engineering that leads to good software. Like:
good design and code reviews, tons of test coverage across many scenarios,
diverse and well-instrumented canaries, and thorough performance and
resource use testing. If Google didn't all of that so well, then we
wouldn't accept frequent pushes. Without the frequent upgrade cycle,
Chromes feature cycle would languish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getelectron.com/"&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is another bright spot. This is the framework that gives
Slack and GitHub's thick clients their fit and finish. It makes these feel
like true native apps, even though they are mostly web controls with
JavaScript the covers. Right-clicking still doesn't do what I want, and
text controls are finicky, but it's close. But what those rough edges buy
you, and the software producer, are frequent, reliable, and clean
upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My natural preference would be for thick apps. If they were done well,
I'd use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/thick-apps/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Aug 2015 20:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>My Next Job</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/job-15/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/snowflake.png" alt="Snowflake" width="25%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left &lt;a href="http://www.wavefront.com/"&gt;my last job&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks back and it's high time to look for a new
one. If you're working on something interesting and think I could help, &lt;a href="mailto:sefklon@gmail.com"&gt;let
me know&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice to not have a day job while looking for another. I was lucky enough
to do this &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201204my-sabbatical.html"&gt;once before in 2012&lt;/a&gt; which turned out great. I learned then
that time and flexibility lets you talk to lots of friends and learn about a
breadth of projects. I found a fun project in a new domain (&lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201207on-line-education.html"&gt;online
education&lt;/a&gt;), something I doubt I'd have found the normal way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I'll get lucky again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough small talk, what am I looking for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking for some flavor of &lt;strong&gt;line manager&lt;/strong&gt;. I'm a good senior manager and
code-every-day engineer; but I'm exceptional leading a team and running a
project. That's what line managers do: lead engineers, not other managers or
departments or matrix-anything. Also, if you're some kind of executive then
coding is an indulgence, and I'd rather it just be part of my job. Mostly I'm
talking to &lt;strong&gt;small companies&lt;/strong&gt;, say 10-100 people (fun-size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to &lt;strong&gt;build on my experience&lt;/strong&gt;. I know infrastructure and cloud, SaaS
and enterprise, and online education. I'm probably not the best person for
your storage, security, gaming, e-commerce, or cryptocurrency company. I want
to stay working on &lt;strong&gt;Internet technology&lt;/strong&gt;. I like the (micro)services model.
For my own projects I choose Python, JavaScript (frontend and backend), and
Java. I know web operations, especially the &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/aws.html"&gt;Amazon stack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt; is important: I don't want to do a daily Menlo Park to San
Francisco round-trip. I'd like to &lt;strong&gt;work with friends&lt;/strong&gt; if possible. And I
want to do something &lt;strong&gt;worthwhile&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can always get to my resume from the header here, or via this &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/sef-resume"&gt;short
link&lt;/a&gt;. I'm open to a bunch of things, just no &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEgu7jdc_fs"&gt;kick boxing&lt;/a&gt;.  Let's
have coffee/drink or take a walk.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/job-15/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2015 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
