&lt;p&gt;It's been nice having AI tools at the ready for cleanup work. You know, those
tasks that require a little program or script. Sure you can write it yourself,
but it won't be fun, and it'll take some time, so instead you just don't bother
and it doesn't get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of just knocking this out I decided this would be a fun one to try with
the two tools I'm using the most these days, &lt;strong&gt;Gemini&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Claude&lt;/strong&gt;. I can't
really call this a proper bakeoff, since it's just those two and it's not an
especially hard task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the result? Both did well but Gemini did a little better.&lt;/strong&gt; Gemini got it
right on the first try; Claude had two bugs that were easy to find and fix.
Claude was a little nicer to work with and produced a nicer description of the
solution. Aside from that, the end product was identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Task&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to clean up the some of the old files backing this blog. I migrated the
site from Wordpress to Nikola in 2013. Even back then I &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/switching-to-static.md"&gt;complained
about&lt;/a&gt; the crufty file format, but couldn't be
bothered to fix it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prompt describes in a fair bit of detail what I wanted done. Probably too
much detail. It's down at the bottom of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to see what they did is to just look at the resulting commits:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/4a91a57dc965b1e77c05fafbc05fa14f1a293c7f"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/commit/78cee0789d98677c5298df543e895d7e2002ff72"&gt;Claude&lt;/a&gt;. They're pretty similar. I asked both to save
their work in a &lt;code&gt;migration_scripts&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory, including a it's own summary
of the work and full log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both tools I pay the $20/month that gives me access to reasonable token
limits and good production models -- Gemini 3 and Sonnet 4.6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts on Claude&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't describe the problem as "Wordpress-style naming" but Claude sussed that
out. Honestly I'd forgotten that was the source of the problem. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like that Claude inserted comments in the configuration file without being
asked to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being told to test, there were two bugs that I had to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of redirects broken. I pointed the problem out and it did more thorough
  testing using &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and found the problem. The new format was what Gemini
  came up with in the first pass (luck? smarts?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A missing newline between the metadata and the body caused the hero images
  to be dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="side by side view showing bug" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/cleanup-missing-hero.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thoughts on Gemini&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't used the Gemini CLI as much by this point. It seems to have borrowed
much of it's UI and flow from Claude code (slash commands, asking questions as
it goes) so it's familiar. It's really nice to use, just a smidgen less mature
and polished than Gemini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I preferred Claude's writeup a little so I went with that one. But Gemini wins
the prize for nailing the task on the first try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked how Claude shows how much of it's context window is used via the
&lt;code&gt;/context&lt;/code&gt; command. I had a harder time getting this kind of thing out of
Gemini, and even when I did it was harder to grok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't tell with either if I'm getting close to any global usage limits. I
should hope not, this wasn't a very big job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Claude &lt;code&gt;/context&lt;/code&gt; Output&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Claude context window usage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/claude-context.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Gemini &lt;code&gt;/stats model&lt;/code&gt; Output&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='Gemini "stats for nerds"' src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/gemini-context.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Prompt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both started with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;First read DEV.md for context about this web site.

In the posts subdirectory are many files that follow an old 
naming convention.  Please convert them all to the new file
naming convention.

The old convention has files of the format YYYYMM&amp;lt;slug&amp;gt;.SUFFIX,
where YYYY is the year, MM is the month, and SUFFIX is html or
meta. &amp;lt;slug&amp;gt; is the short form of the the title, and should match
the "slug" field in the metadata

To convert to the new convention

1. Drop the YYYYMM file prefix

2. Combine the "html" and "meta" files into one markdown file
   with a "md" suffix. The contents of "meta" are at the top of
   the file as an HTML comment

3. Add redirects so the old names can still be served. Add tuples
   in the REDIRECTIONS of conf.py

Use the `nikola build` and `nikola serve` commands to test your
work. Make sure all old URL's still function. Make sure pages
look the same. Make sure tags still work.

Do not commit changes. Do not push to production.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also checked in a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/sefk.github.io/blob/dev/DEV.md"&gt;&lt;code&gt;DEV.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file that described the purpose, directory
layout, and some constraints. Again, maybe overkill, but I figured this isn't
the last time I'll be asking one of these tools to help me futz with this site.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>AI</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/gemini-claude-cleanup/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Yeah, I Did Some Vibe Coding Too</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/daleks/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a story about my recent experience Vibe Coding. The work itself isn't
impressive and this writeup isn't different than the many gee-whiz posts you see
these days. I didn't do &lt;a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/116014270900193494"&gt;three apps in a day&lt;/a&gt;. But I wanted to write up my
experience, mostly to give me an excuse to tell an old tyme programming story
from the 1900's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/daleks"&gt;
&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/daleks-2026.png" alt="Screenshot of my recent Daleks game" width="50%"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Today, 2026&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/"&gt;on a break&lt;/a&gt; I'm taking a &lt;a href="https://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/courses/detail/20252_TECH-42"&gt;Vibe Coding class&lt;/a&gt;. It's a fun excuse to
play with some new toys, and it's well taught, and I like doing things with my
friend Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting tidbit: the first day of class, February 3, 2026, was one year
and one day after "vibe coding" itself was coined via &lt;a href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. That name seems
to have stuck, for the time being at least. On &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/678"&gt;last week's ATP&lt;/a&gt; they said that
by this time next year this will probably just be called "coding" and I bet
they're right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway our week one assignment was to code up a game. &lt;strong&gt;In about two hours and
$10&lt;/strong&gt; I had a something up and running. I spent another couple of hours futzing
with version control, documentation, and hosting. But that's it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's pretty basic, and not all that much fun, but you can &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/daleks"&gt;play it here&lt;/a&gt;. It's
hosted on Github pages, just like this blog. The code and construction notes are
in &lt;a href="https://github.com/sefk/daleks"&gt;checked in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first experience with &lt;a href="https://replit.com/"&gt;Replit&lt;/a&gt;. It's impressive and fun. This was
what was recommended for the class and the good folks at Replit were nice enough
to give us all $30 in credits, which I had plenty to spare. Most of my comrades
presented apps that were fancier than mind with 3d graphics, sound, and more
interactive game play. some also said though that they ended up spending much
more than I did, so YMMV on costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting part was dealing with integration. To get their code deployed
onto my personal website site required wiring up a GitHub workflow, which I'd
never done before. No problem, Replit took care of that too. Then I asked
&lt;a href="https://geminicli.com/"&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt; to get local hosting running. When I hit a permissions problem and a
crash I had to resist the urge to copy paste the error messages into a search
boxes and Stack Overflow, like I've done for years. Instead I asked Gemini to
debug and sort this out for itself and it did straight away. Pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/3913-daleks"&gt;
&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/daleks-1984.jpeg" alt="Original Daleks game from 1984" width="45%"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Forty Years Ago, 1985&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why'd I pick this weird old &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_%28BSD_game%29"&gt;chase game&lt;/a&gt;? Well, that's the more fun and
nostalgic part of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was fourteen years old, I spent the summer hand-coding a video game. I'd
gone to a family gathering and my older cousin Erik brought his Mac from
college. It was the first I'd seen a Mac and fell in love. I thought the
Daleks game he had running on it was so cool. The screenshot on the right
is from that Classic Mac website of that game that I found online, and is
exactly how I remember it looked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon return to Fresno I got to work. I spent most of the rest of that summer
writing a clone of Daleks on my Apple //e. All hand-coded 6502 opcodes and twos
complement math for branch offsets by hand (I didn't have an assembler), in
pencil on graph paper. The hardest part was getting smooth animation working,
since the Apple //e "hi res" &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_graphics"&gt;graphics system&lt;/a&gt; was super quirky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took about two months to get it working. It's the first time I can remember
being in a flow state and I loved it. It was my first "real program" and began
my lifelong love of computers.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>AI</category><category>Tech</category><category>War Stories</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/daleks/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thanks, Daisy Disk</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/daisy-disk/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/daisy-disk-full.png" alt="Screenshot of Daisy Disk with a disk nearly full" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I've been beguiled by my local disk being almost full. This is on my
everyday M3 MacBook Air running the latest Tahoe 26.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I've used &lt;a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/"&gt;Daisy Disk&lt;/a&gt; to debug space issues like this, it's great.
In this case it showed the problem, but wasn't able to narrow down what the
problem was nor remove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not have any success through the normal means ("Googling around"), I wrote the
developer of Daisy Disk, &lt;a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/about/"&gt;Oleg&lt;/a&gt;. They explained the problem and suggested a
workaround. It worked like a champ! I included the explanation below and
screenshots showing before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to say thanks to Oleg for their help. And this is a nice opportunity to
say thank you to indie developers in general who are often so helpful sharing
their expertise. What a wonderful and important part of our community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oleg's explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This error has recently been reported by a few other users as well, and our
investigation shows that it's caused by a new bug in macOS, introduced in one
of its recent updates. (It didn't happen before). The symptom is exactly like
in your case - a Time Machine snapshot becomes damaged for unknown reason, and
it cannot be deleted in the normal way - not only in DaisyDisk, but also not
in Terminal, using the tmutil command-line tool. Moreover, the tmutil tool
doesn't even list the damaged snapshot. It becomes almost entirely lost, while
it still consumes disk space.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We have found the following workaround solution. Please launch the system's Disk
Utility (/Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility.app) and in the left sidebar,
select your data volume, likely called "Macintosh HD - Data". Note that there
will also be another volume called "Macintosh HD" (without "Data"), but you
should select specifically "Macintosh HD - Data". Then select the View \&amp;gt; Show
APFS Snapshots menu command. In the lower part of the window, you will see the
damaged Time Machine snapshot in the list. Please select it and then click the
"-" (minus) button at the bottom to delete it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And screenshots showing the before and after. Note the two broken snapshots in
the list below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Disk utility showing disk almost full" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/daisy-disk-before.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments should produce &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good"&gt;public goods&lt;/a&gt;, like navigation aids and roads. That
seems like a reasonable thing to expect of a functioning government, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider data a public good too. We all benefit from accurate maps,
thorough measurements of the natural world, and trustworthy economic data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is why it was I was so upset when I heard how the the current US
administration has been on a tear to &lt;strong&gt;actually remove data&lt;/strong&gt;. All through 2025,
websites were taking down and datasets were taken offline. This &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_government_online_resource_removals"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt;
catalogs what's been happening, and this report by the &lt;a href="https://www.amstat.org/policy-and-advocacy/the-nation's-data-at-risk-meeting-american's-information-needs-for-the-21st-century"&gt;American Statistical
Association&lt;/a&gt; goes into more depth about what's been happening and its
implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response the &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/"&gt;Data Rescue Project&lt;/a&gt; sprang into action. They're a group of
concerned academics, librarians, and citizens who have been copying and
cataloging datasets so they aren't lost. The &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/press/"&gt;project's press page&lt;/a&gt; has links to
many articles and presentations that describe their work and its impact. Last
November I saw a call for volunteers for DRP on a mailing list of ex-Googlers
and was eager to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth describing a bit about the particular dataset I actually worked on:
Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD). It's a good case study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIFLD is a collection of maps. Maps of basic stuff, like roads, levees, river
depth charts, locations of military bases. Beyond just being good maps, a big
part of HIFLD's value is helping to make sure everyone uses &lt;em&gt;the same maps&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So HIFLD is mostly curating data. Most of the data comes from other agencies
(USGS, Army Corps of Engineers, Census Bureau) and HIFLD brings it together and
provides it in a trustworthy, central place. Well, I should say "provided"
because in September the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1lkol3s/sad_news_hifld_open_to_be_discontinued_by_sept_30/"&gt;government stopped providing it&lt;/a&gt;. The story is well
told in this good &lt;a href="https://projectgeospatial.org/geospatial-frontiers/the-rise-power-and-uncertain-future-of-americas-open-infrastructure-data"&gt;article on Project Geospatial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the Data Rescue Project comes in. DRP volunteers immediately
scooped up the data and kept in temporary storage. Then they organized a bucket
brigade of volunteers to categorize and put &lt;a href="https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies?q=hifld%20open"&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt; into long-term storage.
Importantly, this was coupled with metadata to ensure they're findable later.
That's the part I worked on, uploading and entering metadata. We met our goal of
getting all of HIFLD "rescued" by year's end. &lt;a href="https://libguides.brown.edu/prf.php?account_id=276524"&gt;Frank Donnelly&lt;/a&gt;, the project
manager, wrote up a nice &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/hifld-data-saved/"&gt;summary&lt;/a&gt; of what we did and how. For my piece I relied
on a nice Selenium driver, written by another volunteer, to create over a
hundred projects (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dVadwqbJoSs"&gt;screen recording&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one of many DRP efforts. Check out their &lt;a href="https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/"&gt;tracker&lt;/a&gt; to see the
breadth of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'm proud of this project, I keep reminding myself that we're playing
defense. Having a one-time snapshot isn't nearly as good as having the
government actually do its job. Which is why we need to keep demanding better
leadership and a return to effective government. Assert your rights and
&lt;a href="https://www.nokings.org/"&gt;protest&lt;/a&gt;!   ❌ 👑.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Civics</category><category>Life</category><category>Tech</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/data-preservation/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Rob Reiner: "Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every day."</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/rob-reiner/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/rob-reiner.jpg" alt="Photo of Rob Reiner from Wikipedia, source Neil Grabowsky / Montclair Film Festival" width="30%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to have met and shared a meal with Rob Reiner some years back. I
wanted to take a moment to share this story on the sad occasion of his death
this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 2003 or so. I lived and worked for Akamai in Boston. I had been going
back and forth to San Mateo office a fair bit that year, often taking a red eye
home from San Jose. Back then the San Jose airport was smaller than it is now,
and was especially quiet at the evenings. Not a lot of dinner options, so
McDonald's it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day I was surprised to recognize Rob Reiner in line right in front of me!
He was traveling with some assistant-type person, patiently waiting. I tend to
not bother celebrities in public, but I was moved to say something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sef&lt;/strong&gt;: Hello Mr. Reiner. Forgive me but I just wanted to say how much I enjoy
your work. I'm a really big fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt; (big grin): Hi! What's your name? Thanks for introducing
yourself. What have I done that you like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think he genuinely wanted to know. I knew his big films pretty well —
&lt;em&gt;When Harry Met Sally&lt;/em&gt; was the most popular, &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt; had been up for
Best Picture, &lt;em&gt;Spinal Tap&lt;/em&gt; is well, Spinal Tap. These are all really great
films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sef&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Princess Bride&lt;/em&gt;, hands down. I love the story and I love what you
did with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm glad you said that. That's my favorite too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that was more than I'd hoped for. I thanked him and begged off so he
could order his burger and have dinner in peace. But no, in that New Yorker
voice and with a big smile he said, "C'mon, let's have cheeseburgers!" The three
of us all sat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a nice talk over dinner. He asked questions and seemed genuinely
interested in what I did -- work, family. But the highlight was toward the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt;: What else can I answer for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sef&lt;/strong&gt;: What would you tell someone early in their career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I was about thirty years old, so hardly &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; early in my own
career, but I was asking in a genuine way. He answered straight away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Reiner&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;mark&gt;Whatever you like to do, do a lot of it. Do it every
day.&lt;/mark&gt; Me, I like writing so I try to do that of it every day if I can.
That's how you get good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then told a few stories about people he'd met who don't do this. I guess when
you're someone like him, people ask you frequently for jobs or if you'd produce
their movie or whatnot. He said he asks what was the last thing they'd written,
or what they were working on now, or what'd they'd written today. And he could
tell if they did it often and did it for fun. If they didn't do it often, then
how good a writer were they likely to be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was struck by what a nice and interesting, and interested, person Rob Reiner
was. It was incredibly generous for him to spend time with a fanboy when he
could be off duty and just enjoying his cheeseburger. What a gem.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Appreciation</category><category>Life</category><category>Media</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/rob-reiner/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>No More Blog Comments</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/enshittification/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;div style="float:right; align:right; width:30%; font-size:150px"&gt;
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;💩&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned off comments on this site today. The good people at &lt;a href="https://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; had
provided me with a free service for commenting that had worked for ten-plus
years. But they appear to have gone down the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification"&gt;enshittification&lt;/a&gt; path and
started running a bunch of link-spam right above the comment box on all my
pages. Of course they did. I captured a &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/disqus-enshittified.png"&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see. Boo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame on me for entrusting a company to handle content for my personal site in
the first place. Isn't controlling things the whole point of this old-school
blog business? Not a big loss, nobody had posted a comment in a long time. But
still.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Technology</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/enshittification/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2025 00:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Three Months</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/three-months/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I've been &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google"&gt;off work&lt;/a&gt; for about three months now. It's a
good occasion to take stock of how that's going. In a word, it's been &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/activities.jpeg" alt="Meme from the movie \" step brothers\" showing men playing in a bedroom with the caption \"we have so much room for activities.\"" width="50%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised how much lighter my mood is. It feels like a weight that I've
  been carrying around for some time is no longer there. It's different than
  being on vacation, better actually. I didn't appreciate how stressful
  tech management has been all these years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm taking a ton of pleasure in simple things. I go grocery shopping almost
  every day, I'm doing a ton of cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels good to get healthier. I had knee surgery and am recovering from that
  just fine. I exercise nearly every day. On days that I don't go to &lt;a href="https://www.bayclubs.com/clubs/redwoodshores"&gt;the
  gym&lt;/a&gt; I do thirty minutes on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's great to have flexibility. I hadn't planned to see my Dad on his 80th
  birthday because we'd on a bigger group thing later. But on a whim I drove
  down and took him out for breakfast on his actual birthday, because why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I didn't want to do it before, I still don't want to do it. The closet
  hasn't gotten cleaned out; neither has the garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Rachel Grey has a three month head start leaving Google. Her
writing this resonates with me. Especially this from recent LinkedIn post
(&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rachel-grey-b69319_after-six-months-out-of-tech-my-primary-ugcPost-7383907826374582272-yCCs"&gt;private, sorry&lt;/a&gt;): "one month off per year of service is a good rule of
thumb; after six of them, I'm still feeling like a sailor who just barely
managed to swim to shore." Maybe that's still where I'm at too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what have I been doing?  I'm prioritizing friends and family — I'm
lucky to have a lot of people I care about. I'm embarrassed that I haven't
always been good about staying in touch, but I can fix that now. And fun stuff
like &lt;a href="https://planet-bridge.org/index.php"&gt;bridge lessons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I'm getting involved with a couple of small projects but nothing
serious yet. When I find something interesting, I'll write about it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/three-months/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Leaving Google</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/google-10year.jpeg" alt="Sef holding a framed certificate, Google ten years of service." width="60%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An offer of a Voluntary Exit from Google HR landed in my mailbox right around my
ten-year anniversary with the company, give or take. We'd had a couple of
packages like this at Google before (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;), basically the same deal you'd
get if you got laid off. But this was the first one put in front of those of us
working in one of the revenue engines of the company — I worked on Search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't aiming to leave. I liked the work, I had a good team and boss. But
the package was enough to kickstart a discussion, "why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; now?". My wife and
I ran numbers and discussed our futures. I clicked the button. My last day as a
Googler was earlier this week, October 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have good feelings about my time at Google. It was nice that I saw a some
different parts of the business: some consumer (three years at YouTube, four
years at Search) and some enterprise (three years at Cloud). I got to play with
big infrastructure and solve some hard problems. I saw behind the curtain. But
the best part was the smart and interesting people I got to work with. I know
it's a cliche, but it's the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything was great. I've decided to not use this space for dishy stories
about how Google isn't all it claims to be. But I sure do love reminiscing and
grousing as much as any engineer. If you want to share war stories over a beer,
I'm always up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's next? I haven't decided if this is retirement, or a sabbatical, or
something else. I've been off work for extended stretches twice before, once by
choice and once not. Those two times taught me that the difference between a
wonderful, mind-expanding time and a stress-fest is my own mindset. And now
that I haven't been really working for six weeks now, I can confidently say
that my mindset is positive and good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited about the next phase. I feel fortunate to have some time to focus on
what's important.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Life</category><category>Technology</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-google/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>A Good Interview Question</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/interview-question/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/python.png" alt="Python language logo" width="25%"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the question that I got when interviewing at YouTube in 2015. At Google
then we'd have an interview panel of four or five people, each assigned to cover
a different area. &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/billy-biggs-7ab1023/"&gt;Billy Biggs&lt;/a&gt; was the TL on my panel asked to evaluate
"architecture." For a manager candidate that mostly meant evaluating technical
cluefulness (someone else had me do some simple &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201205fizzbuzz-for-managers"&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy's question: &lt;strong&gt;Discuss what would cause a Python interpreter to crash. Not
a &lt;em&gt;program written in Python&lt;/em&gt;, but the interpreter itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember this leading to a fun, rambling, back-and-forth discussion of the
&lt;strong&gt;ways computers can fail&lt;/strong&gt;. There are so many! Every level of the stack can
fail in interesting ways: storage, RAM, memory management, networking. How would
a bit flip in a TLB manifest? How does TCP/IP detect and handle ordering?
collisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also covered a bunch of &lt;strong&gt;engineering and process questions&lt;/strong&gt;. How is the
interpreter itself implemented, in what language and by whom? What would the
quality processes be like for a product like that, especially given Python is
presumably a really large open source project? How would you manage this? How
important to quality is the role of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life"&gt;BDFL&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then that lead to a some more interesting higher-level discussions about the
actual &lt;strong&gt;costs and benefits of addressing failures&lt;/strong&gt; like these in the field.
When should programs hard-fail versus detect and recover? How would you staff an
engineering team to find and chase down errors? What's the user impact to a
failure like this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things about this question is most likely it was something
they'd actually seen right in their backyard. In 2015 significant parts of
YouTube was &lt;a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2006-December/070323.html"&gt;written in Python&lt;/a&gt; (that's likely not the case anymore, I don't
know). Crashes like these must have come up in the field. Not only are
real-world problems relatively easy to ask, but they have the added benefit of
showing the candidate the kinds of issues that the team actually deals with. It's
also a well-shaped question: open ended, no right/wrong answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the job.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Engineering</category><category>Management</category><category>War Stories</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/interview-question/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Naming Is Hard</title><link>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/naming/</link><dc:creator>Sef Kloninger</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right" class="postimage" src="https://sef.kloninger.com/f/lena.png" alt="Photo of Lena Forsén" width="40%"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about how hard it is to come up with a good name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in 2013. I was part of a team building a &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/201207on-line-education/"&gt;system for online
education&lt;/a&gt; at Stanford. We &lt;a href="https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/stanford-launches-class2go-open-source-platform-online-classes"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; a nice little site,
Class2Go, with a small team in a few months. It worked well and
supported the basic features of an online course: videos, assessments,
auth, reporting. We decided to keep it going and worked on it for
another year, expanding the covered use cases and taking on more
classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even from the beginning the name &lt;em&gt;Class2Go&lt;/em&gt; felt a bit off. Our
original aim was to enable offline &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;MOOC&lt;/a&gt; students, people trying
to take classes offline or in poorly-connected places But we ended
up pivoting away from the offline use case to more standard
hosted-course features. It became a little multi-tenant CMS with a
small database for auth, assessment results, and some basic analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to rebrand. Someone knew a naming consultant, presumably
an alum, and soon enough we had an expert on board. They were really
interesting to work with. After understanding the platform's goals
and features, they generated hundreds of candidate names. Each was
vetting for domain name availability and copyright conflicts. The
consultant was good at their job, bringing us something like a hundred
candidate names (I wish I still had that list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One name caught everyone's attention: &lt;strong&gt;Tindra&lt;/strong&gt;. It's a Swedish
word that means "sparkle" or "twinkle." It's evocative and easy to
say. It also happens to be a woman's name, but not a particularly
common one we were told. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, &lt;code&gt;tindra.com&lt;/code&gt; was available! In 2013 short and catchy
domain names were getting hard to come The &lt;a href="https://newgtldprogram.icann.org/"&gt;new gTLD program&lt;/a&gt; had
only just been approved in 2012, and &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.org&lt;/code&gt; were pretty
crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that if you Googled "tindra," the top result was a
Swedish adult film actress! Not good. Maybe with enough SEO juice,
over time, we would have overtaken that. But on launch day, that's
not the association you want to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up punting on the problem and going with a generic name,
&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Online&lt;/strong&gt;. It got the job done, but felt like a missed
opportunity. We later merged with edX and &lt;a href="https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/leaving-stanford/"&gt;I found another job&lt;/a&gt;.
Eventually the team re-branded the site with the name &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.stanford.edu/lagunita-learning-platform"&gt;Lagunita&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;,
the name of the lake on campus, which they're still using today. I
like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admit I still have a thing for Tindra though. The name, not the actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postscript: &lt;code&gt;tindra.com&lt;/code&gt; still doesn't seem to be used for anything
today. It looks to just be parked by a German domain registrar.
Google results don't seem to be a problem. Maybe it's available for
something interesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Jane Manning for her review, she was there too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Education</category><category>Technology</category><category>War Stories</category><guid>https://sef.kloninger.com/posts/naming/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
